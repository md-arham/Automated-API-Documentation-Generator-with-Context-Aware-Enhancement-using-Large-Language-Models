{"source_file":"bitbucket.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: POST | Path: \/repositories\/{workspace}\/{repo_slug}\/src | Summary: Create a commit by uploading a file | Tags: Source, Repositories","target_text":"This endpoint is used to create new commits in the repository by uploading files. To add a new file to a repository: ``` $ curl https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/username\/slug\/src \\ -F \/repo\/path\/to\/image.png=@image.png ``` This will create a new commit on top of the main branch, inheriting the contents of the main branch, but adding (or overwriting) the `image.png` file to the repository in the `\/repo\/path\/to` directory. To create a commit that deletes files, use the `files` parameter: ``` $ curl https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/username\/slug\/src \\ -F files=\/file\/to\/delete\/1.txt \\ -F files=\/file\/to\/delete\/2.txt ``` You can add\/modify\/delete multiple files in a request. Rename\/move a file by deleting the old path and adding the content at the new path. This endpoint accepts `multipart\/form-data` (as in the examples above), as well as `application\/x-www-form-urlencoded`. #### multipart\/form-data A `multipart\/form-data` post contains a series of \"form fields\" that identify both the individual files that are being uploaded, as well as additional, optional meta data. Files are uploaded in file form fields (those that have a `Content-Disposition` parameter) whose field names point to the remote path in the repository where the file should be stored. Path field names are always interpreted to be absolute from the root of the repository, regardless whether the client uses a leading slash (as the above `curl` example did). File contents are treated as bytes and are not decoded as text. The commit message, as well as other non-file meta data for the request, is sent along as normal form field elements. Meta data fields share the same namespace as the file objects. For `multipart\/form-data` bodies that should not lead to any ambiguity, as the `Content-Disposition` header will contain the `filename` parameter to distinguish between a file named \"message\" and the commit message field. #### application\/x-www-form-urlencoded It is also possible to upload new files using a simple `application\/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST. This can be convenient when uploading pure text files: ``` $ curl https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src \\ --data-urlencode \"\/path\/to\/me.txt=Lorem ipsum.\" \\ --data-urlencode \"message=Initial commit\" \\ --data-urlencode \"author=Erik van Zijst \" ``` There could be a field name clash if a client were to upload a file named \"message\", as this filename clashes with the meta data property for the commit message. To avoid this and to upload files whose names clash with the meta data properties, use a leading slash for the files, e.g. `curl --data-urlencode \"\/message=file contents\"`. When an explicit slash is omitted for a file whose path matches that of a meta data parameter, then it is interpreted as meta data, not as a file. #### Executables and links While this API aims to facilitate the most common use cases, it is possible to perform some more advanced operations like creating a new symlink in the repository, or creating an executable file. Files can be supplied with a `x-attributes` value in the `Content-Disposition` header. For example, to upload an executable file, as well as create a symlink from `README.txt` to `README`: ``` --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: text\/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-ID: \"bin\/shutdown.sh\" Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"shutdown.sh\"; x-attributes:\"executable\" #!\/bin\/sh halt --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: text\/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-ID: \"\/README.txt\" Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"README.txt\"; x-attributes:\"link\" README --===============1438169132528273974==-- ``` Links are files that contain the target path and have `x-attributes:\"link\"` set. When overwriting links with files, or vice versa, the newly uploaded file determines both the new contents, as well as the attributes. That means uploading a file without specifying `x-attributes=\"link\"` will create a regular file, even if the parent commit hosted a symlink at the same path. The same applies to executables. When modifying an existing executable file, the form-data file element must include `x-attributes=\"executable\"` in order to preserve the executable status of the file. Note that this API does not support the creation or manipulation of subrepos \/ submodules."}

You can define an event trigger on any of the following objects: * Account * AccountingCode * AccountingPeriod * Amendment * BillingRun * Contact * CreditBalanceAdjustment * CreditMemo * CreditMemoApplication * CreditMemoApplicationItem * CreditMemoItem * DebitMemo * DebitMemoItem * Feature * Invoice * InvoiceAdjustment * InvoiceItem * InvoiceItemAdjustment * JournalEntry * JournalEntryItem * Order * OrderAction * Payment * PaymentApplication * PaymentMethod * PaymentPart * Product * ProductFeature * ProductRatePlan * ProductRatePlanCharge * RatePlan * RatePlanCharge * Refund * RefundApplication * RevenueEvent * RevenueEventItem * RevenueSchedule * RevenueScheduleItem * Subscription * SubscriptionProductFeature * TaxationItem * Usage #### Tenant level base objects and tenant level event triggers Zuora identifies the following base objects as the tenant level base objects: * AccountingCode * AccountingPeriod * BillingRun * Feature * JournalEntry * JournalEntryItem * Product * ProductFeature * ProductRatePlan * ProductRatePlanCharge Event triggers defined on tenant level base objects are tenant level event triggers. Notifications associated with tenant level events are system notifications. **Note:** Tenant level event triggers and system notifications are only available in the default profile. ### Define the trigger condition The `condition` field is a [JEXL](http:\/\/commons.apache.org\/proper\/commons-jexl\/) expression that specifies when to trigger events. The expression can contain fields from the object that the trigger is defined on. **Note:** The condition cannot contain fields from [data source](https:\/\/knowledgecenter.zuora.com\/DC_Developers\/M_Export_ZOQL) objects that are joined to the object that the trigger is defined on. For example, the following condition causes an event to be triggered whenever an invoice is posted with an amount greater than 1000: ```changeType == 'UPDATE' && Invoice.Status == 'Posted' && Invoice.Status_old != 'Posted' && Invoice.Amount > 1000``` Where: * `changeType` is a keyword that specifies the type of change that occurred to the Invoice object. For all objects, the supported values of `changeType` are `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. * `Invoice.Status` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field after the change occurred. * `Invoice.Status_old` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field before the change occurred. In the above example, the value of `baseObject` is `Invoice`. ### Limitations This event trigger has the following limitations: * The maximum number of event triggers is 20. If you want to increase the limit, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https:\/\/support.zuora.com). * The INSERT change type is not supported on RatePlan base objects. * The INSERT change type is not supported on SubscriptionProductFeature base objects."}

If more than one criteria is specified, they are joined with the logical *AND*: only issues that satisfy all criteria are eligible. If an invalid combination of criteria is provided, an error is returned. For example, specifying a `currentValue` and `hasProperty` as *false* would not match any issues (because without the property the property cannot have a value). The filter is optional. Without the filter all the issues visible to the user and where the user has the EDIT\\_ISSUES permission for the issue are considered eligible. This operation is: * transactional, either all eligible issues are updated or, when errors occur, none are updated. * [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the response to determine the status of the task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-3-task-taskId-get) to obtain subsequent updates. **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** * *Browse projects* [project permission](https:\/\/confluence.atlassian.com\/x\/yodKLg) for each project containing issues. * If [issue-level security](https:\/\/confluence.atlassian.com\/x\/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue. * *Edit issues* [project permission](https:\/\/confluence.atlassian.com\/x\/yodKLg) for each issue."}

There are a number of query parameters (below) that can be used to filter the set of [AuditLogEvent](\/docs\/audit-log-event) objects that are returned in the response. Any combination of query parameters is valid. When no filters are provided, all of the events that have been captured in your domain will match. The list of events will always be [paginated](\/docs\/pagination). The default limit is 1000 events. The next set of events can be retrieved using the `offset` from the previous response. If there are no events that match the provided filters in your domain, the endpoint will return `null` for the `next_page` field. Querying again with the same filters may return new events if they were captured after the last request. Once a response includes a `next_page` with an `offset`, subsequent requests can be made with the latest `offset` to poll for new events that match the provided filters. When no `offset` is provided, the response will begin with the oldest events that match the provided filters. It is important to note that [AuditLogEvent](\/docs\/audit-log-event) objects will be permanently deleted from our systems after 90 days. If you wish to keep a permanent record of these events, we recommend using a SIEM tool to ingest and store these logs."}

The first part is the JSON document that describes the snippet's properties or meta data. It either has to be the first part, or the request's `Content-Type` header must contain the `start` parameter to point to it. The remaining parts are the files of which there can be zero or more. Each file part should contain the `Content-ID` MIME header through which the JSON meta data's `files` element addresses it. The value should be the name of the file. `Content-Disposition` is an optional MIME header. The header's optional `filename` parameter can be used to specify the file name that Bitbucket should use when writing the file to disk. When present, `filename` takes precedence over the value of `Content-ID`. When the JSON body omits the `files` element, the remaining parts are not ignored. Instead, each file is added to the new snippet as if its name was explicitly linked (the use of the `files` elements is mandatory for some operations like deleting or renaming files). multipart\/form-data ------------------- The use of JSON for the snippet's meta data is optional. Meta data can also be supplied as regular form fields in a more conventional `multipart\/form-data` request: $ curl -X POST -u credentials https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/snippets -F title=\"My snippet\" -F file=@foo.txt -F file=@image.png POST \/2.0\/snippets HTTP\/1.1 Content-Length: 951 Content-Type: multipart\/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f ------------------------------63a4b224c59f Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"foo.txt\" Content-Type: text\/plain foo ------------------------------63a4b224c59f Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"image.png\" Content-Type: application\/octet-stream ?PNG IHDR?1??I..... ------------------------------63a4b224c59f Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"title\" My snippet ------------------------------63a4b224c59f-- Here the meta data properties are included as flat, top-level form fields. The file attachments use the `file` field name. To attach multiple files, simply repeat the field. The advantage of `multipart\/form-data` over `multipart\/related` is that it can be easier to build clients. Essentially all properties are optional, `title` and `files` included. Sharing and Visibility ---------------------- Snippets can be either public (visible to anyone on Bitbucket, as well as anonymous users), or private (visible only to members of the workspace). This is controlled through the snippet's `is_private` element: * **is_private=false** -- everyone, including anonymous users can view the snippet * **is_private=true** -- only workspace members can view the snippet To create the snippet under a workspace, just append the workspace ID to the URL. See [`\/2.0\/snippets\/{workspace}`](\/cloud\/bitbucket\/rest\/api-group-snippets\/#api-snippets-workspace-post)."}

A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. You should use our [recommended payments integrations](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/payments) to perform this process client-side. This ensures that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way. If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if your integration uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance that may be required, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer's information is not sent directly to Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is handled or stored. Tokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, you can create [Customer](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api#customers) objects or [Custom accounts](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api#external_accounts). Note that [Radar](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.

When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded` event; and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an `invoice.payment_failed` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple events to be created. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event. Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice. As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api#list_events) from the API. We also have a separate [webhooks](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Webhook) system for sending the `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are managed in your [account settings](https:\/\/dashboard.stripe.com\/account\/webhooks), and our [Using Webhooks](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/webhooks) guide will help you get set up. When using [Connect](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/connect), you can also receive notifications of events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object. **NOTE:** Right now, access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api#retrieve_event) is guaranteed only for 30 days."}

For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/search\/search#text-match-metadata). For example, if you want to find the oldest unresolved Python bugs on Windows. Your query might look something like this. `q=windows+label:bug+language:python+state:open&sort=created&order=asc` This query searches for the keyword `windows`, within any open issue that is labeled as `bug`. The search runs across repositories whose primary language is Python. The results are sorted by creation date in ascending order, which means the oldest issues appear first in the search results. **Note:** For requests made by GitHub Apps with a user access token, you can't retrieve a combination of issues and pull requests in a single query. Requests that don't include the `is:issue` or `is:pull-request` qualifier will receive an HTTP `422 Unprocessable Entity` response. To get results for both issues and pull requests, you must send separate queries for issues and pull requests.

There are a couple of different options to initiate a pipeline, where the payload of the request will determine which type of pipeline will be instantiated. # Trigger a Pipeline for a branch One way to trigger pipelines is by specifying the branch for which you want to trigger a pipeline. The specified branch will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will then do a clone of the repository and checkout the latest revision of the specified branch. ### Example ``` $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\ -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\ https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/jeroendr\/meat-demo2\/pipelines\/ \\ -d ' { \"target\": { \"ref_type\": \"branch\", \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\", \"ref_name\": \"master\" } }' ``` # Trigger a Pipeline for a commit on a branch or tag You can initiate a pipeline for a specific commit and in the context of a specified reference (e.g. a branch, tag or bookmark). The specified reference will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will clone the repository and then do a checkout the specified reference. The following reference types are supported: * `branch` * `named_branch` * `bookmark` * `tag` ### Example ``` $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\ -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\ https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/jeroendr\/meat-demo2\/pipelines\/ \\ -d ' { \"target\": { \"commit\": { \"type\": \"commit\", \"hash\": \"ce5b7431602f7cbba007062eeb55225c6e18e956\" }, \"ref_type\": \"branch\", \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\", \"ref_name\": \"master\" } }' ``` # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit. In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition. The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository and checkout the specified revision. ### Example ``` $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\ -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\ https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/jeroendr\/meat-demo2\/pipelines\/ \\ -d ' { \"target\": { \"commit\": { \"hash\":\"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923\", \"type\":\"commit\" }, \"selector\": { \"type\":\"custom\", \"pattern\":\"Deploy to production\" }, \"type\":\"pipeline_commit_target\" } }' ``` # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit on a branch or tag You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit in the context of a specified reference. In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition, as well as the reference information. The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository a checkout the specified reference. ### Example ``` $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\ -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\ https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/jeroendr\/meat-demo2\/pipelines\/ \\ -d ' { \"target\": { \"commit\": { \"hash\":\"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923\", \"type\":\"commit\" }, \"selector\": { \"type\": \"custom\", \"pattern\": \"Deploy to production\" }, \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\", \"ref_name\": \"master\", \"ref_type\": \"branch\" } }' ``` # Trigger a custom pipeline with variables In addition to triggering a custom pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file as shown in the examples above, you can specify variables that will be available for your build. In the request, provide a list of variables, specifying the following for each variable: key, value, and whether it should be secured or not (this field is optional and defaults to not secured). ### Example ``` $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\ -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\ https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/{workspace}\/{repo_slug}\/pipelines\/ \\ -d ' { \"target\": { \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\", \"ref_type\": \"branch\", \"ref_name\": \"master\", \"selector\": { \"type\": \"custom\", \"pattern\": \"Deploy to production\" } }, \"variables\": [ { \"key\": \"var1key\", \"value\": \"var1value\", \"secured\": true }, { \"key\": \"var2key\", \"value\": \"var2value\" } ] }' ``` # Trigger a pull request pipeline You can also initiate a pipeline for a specific pull request. ### Example ``` $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\ -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\ https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/{workspace}\/{repo_slug}\/pipelines\/ \\ -d ' { \"target\": { \"type\": \"pipeline_pullrequest_target\", \"source\": \"pull-request-branch\", \"destination\": \"master\", \"destination_commit\": { \"hash\" : \"9f848b7\" }, \"commit\": { \"hash\" : \"1a372fc\" }, \"pullrequest\" : { \"id\" : \"3\" }, \"selector\": { \"type\": \"pull-requests\", \"pattern\": \"**\" } } }' ```"}

{"source_file":"zuora.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: POST | Path: \/v1\/action\/subscribe | Summary: Subscribe | Tags: Actions","target_text":"This call performs many actions. Use the subscribe call to bundle information required to create at least one new subscription. The call takes in an array of SubscribeRequests. Because it takes an array, you can submit a batch of subscription requests at once. You can create up to 50 different subscriptions in a single subscribe call. This is a combined call that you can use to perform all of the following tasks in a single call: * Create accounts * Create contacts * Create payment methods, including external payment options * Create an invoice for the subscription * Apply the first payment to a subscription ## Object Limits 50 objects are supported in a single call. ## Effective Date If the effective date is in the future, the invoices will not be generated, and there will be no invoice number. ## Subscription Name, Number, and ID ### Subscription Name and Number The subscription name is a unique identifier for the subscription. If you do not specify a value for the name, Zuora will create one automatically. The automatically generated value is known as the subscription number, such as `A-S00000080`. You cannot change the subscription name or number after creating the subscription. * **Subscription name**: The name that you set for the subscription. * **Subscription number**: The value generated by Zuora automatically if you do not specify a subscription name. Both the subscription name and number must be unique. If they are not, an error will occur. ### Subscription ID The subscription ID is a 32-digit ID in the format 4028xxxx. This is also the unique identifier for a subscription. This value is automatically generated by the system and cannot be edited or updated, but it can be queried. One subscription can have only one subscription name or number, but it can have multiple IDs: Each version of a subscription has a different ID. The Subscription object contains the fields `OriginalId` and `PreviousSubscriptionId`. `OriginalId` is the ID for the first version of a subscription. `PreviousSubscriptionId` is the ID of the version created immediately prior to the current version. ## Subscription Preview You can preview invoices that would be generated by the subscribe call. When previewing invoices with the subscribe call, the correspondinig Contract Effective, Service Activation, or Customer Acceptance date is required if the subscription contains a charge with its trigger event being set as `ContractEffectiveDate`, `ServiceActivationDate`, or `CustomerAcceptanceDate`. ## Invoice Subscriptions Separately If you have enabled the invoice subscriptions separately feature, a subscribe call will generate an invoice for each subscription for every subscription where the field `IsInvoiceSeparate` is set to `true`. If the invoice subscriptions separately feature is disabled, a subscribe call will generate a single invoice for all subscriptions. See [Invoicing Subscriptions Separately](https:\/\/knowledgecenter.zuora.com\/BC_Subscription_Management\/Subscriptions\/B_Creating_Subscriptions\/Invoicing_Subscriptions_Separately) for more information. ## Subscriptions and Draft Invoices If a draft invoice that includes charges exists in a customer account, using the subscribe call to create a new subscription and generate an invoice will cause the new subscription to be added to the existing draft invoice. Zuora will then post the invoice. ## When to Use Subscribe and Create Calls You can use either the subscribe call or the create call to create the objects associated with a subscription (accounts, contacts, and so on). There are differences between these calls, however, and some situations are better for one or the other. ### Use the Subscribe Call The subscribe call bundles up all the information you need for a subscription. Use the subscribe call to create new subscriptions when you have all the information you need. Subscribe calls cannot update BillTo, SoldTo, and Account objects. Payment information objects cannot be updated if there is an existing account ID in the call. These objects are not supported in a subscribe call. ### Use the Create Call The create call is more useful when you want to develop in stages. For example, if you want to first create an account, then a contact, and so on. If you do not have all information available, use the create call. To create a subscription, you must activate the account from Draft status to Active by calling the subscribe call."}

The target must respond with a `200 OK` or `204 No Content` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm that this webhook subscription is indeed expected. We strongly recommend storing this secret to be used to verify future webhook event signatures. The POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status of the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation handshake it will fail to setup, and you will receive an error in response to your attempt to create it.

From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed in the contributors list on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not. Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of contributors, the user relationship will not be exposed and the contributor ID will be an empty string. #### Returns Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys. The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 contributors. Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor. Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response. The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag\/Pagination). #### Filtering You can optionally request that the response only include contributors that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/registrations\/wu3a4\/contributors\/?filter[bibliographic]=true. Contributors may be filtered by their `bibliographic` and `permission` attributes."}

If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/billing\/invoices\/workflow\/#auto_advance), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice. If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https:\/\/dashboard.stripe.com\/account\/billing\/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice. Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge per currency](\/docs\/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.

Each student forks the project to have his or her own copy of the materials to start his\/her own work. When creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current node and components for which you are a contributor. Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked. #### Required There are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked node's attributes will be copied from the current node. The `title` field is optional, with the default title being \"Fork of \" prepended to the current node's title. #### Returns Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the complete srepresentation of the forked node, if the request is successful. If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag\/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed."}

{"source_file":"zuora.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: POST | Path: \/v1\/usage | Summary: Upload a usage file | Tags: Usage","target_text":"This REST API reference describes how to post or import usage data for one or more accounts in the CSV format. There are no path or query parameters. The data is uploaded using the HTTP multipart\/form-data POST method and applied to the user's tenant. For a use case of this operation, see [Upload usage records](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-guides\/#Upload-usage-records). ## How this REST API Call Works The content of the uploaded usage file must follow the format used by the UI import tool. It must be a comma-separated (CSV) file with a corresponding .csv extension. The length of the file name must not exceed 50 characters. The file size must not exceed 4MB. See [Downloading the Usage Template](https:\/\/knowledgecenter.zuora.com\/CB_Billing\/J_Billing_Operations\/Usage\/C_Import_Usage_Data#Downloading_the_Usage_Template) to learn about how to download the usage file template. At the completion of the upload, before the file contents are actually being processed, the API returns a response containing the byte count of the received file and a URL for checking the status of the import process. Of the five possible results displayed at that URL (Pending, Processing, Completed, Canceled, and Failed) only a Completed status indicates that the import was successful. The operation is atomic; if any record fails, the file is rejected. In that case, the entire import is rolled back and all stored data is returned to its original state. To view the actual import status, enter the resulting status URL from the checkImportStatus response using a tool such as POSTMAN. This additional step provides more information about why the import has failed. To manage the information after a successful upload, use the web-based UI. ## Usage File Format The usage file uses the following headings: | Heading | Description | Required | |-----------------|--------|----------| | ACCOUNT_ID | Enter the account number, e.g., the default account number, such as A00000001, or your custom account number. Although this field is labeled as Account_Id, it is not the actual Account ID nor Account Name. | Yes | | UOM | Enter the unit of measure. This must match the UOM for the usage. | Yes | | QTY | Enter the quantity. | Yes | | STARTDATE | Enter the start date of the usage. This date determines the invoice item service period the associated usage is billed to. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM\/DD\/YYYY`. | Yes | | ENDDATE | Enter the end date of the usage. This is not used in calculations for usage billing and is optional. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM\/DD\/YYYY`. **Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required. | No | | SUBSCRIPTION_ID | Enter the subscription number or subscription name. If you created the subscription in the Zuora application, Zuora created a number automatically in a format similar to A-S00000001. If you do not provide a value for this field, the associated usage will be added to all subscriptions for the specified Account that use this Unit Of Measure. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record. **Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required. | No | | CHARGE_ID | Enter the charge number (not the charge name). You can see the charge ID, e.g., C-00000001, when you add your rate plan to your subscription and view your individual charges. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the specific Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record. This field is related to the Charge Number on the subscription rate plan. **Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required. | No | | DESCRIPTION | Enter a description for the charge. | No |"}

A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/help\/conditions\/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles\/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles\/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles\/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles\/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/docs\/)."}

Note: Some events are generated by the system, and will have `null` as the user. API consumers should make sure to handle this case. The `resource` that triggered the event may be different from the one that the events were requested for or the webhook is subscribed to. For example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks contained within the project. **Note:** pay close attention to the relationship between the fields `Event.action` and `Event.change.action`. `Event.action` represents the action taken on the resource itself, and `Event.change.action` represents how the information within the resource's fields have been modified. For instance, consider these scenarios: * When at task is added to a project, `Event.action` will be `added`, `Event.parent` will be an object with the `id` and `type` of the project, and there will be no `change` field. * When an assignee is set on the task, `Event.parent` will be `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`, `Event.change.action` will be `changed`, and `new_value` will be an object with the user's `id` and `type`. * When a collaborator is added to the task, `Event.parent` will be `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`, `Event.change.action` will be `added`, and `added_value` will be an object with the user's `id` and `type`."}

This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the `mergeable` key. For more information, see \"[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/guides\/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)\". The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub Enterprise Server has started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute in the response. If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. The value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on the state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. After merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on how you merged the pull request: * If merged as a [merge commit](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/articles\/about-merge-methods-on-github\/), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit. * If merged via a [squash](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/articles\/about-merge-methods-on-github\/#squashing-your-merge-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base branch. * If [rebased](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/articles\/about-merge-methods-on-github\/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.

Installation tokens expire one hour from the time you create them. Using an expired token produces a status code of `401 - Unauthorized`, and requires creating a new installation token. By default the installation token has access to all repositories that the installation can access. Optionally, you can use the `repositories` or `repository_ids` body parameters to specify individual repositories that the installation access token can access. If you don't use `repositories` or `repository_ids` to grant access to specific repositories, the installation access token will have access to all repositories that the installation was granted access to. The installation access token cannot be granted access to repositories that the installation was not granted access to. Up to 500 repositories can be listed in this manner. Optionally, use the `permissions` body parameter to specify the permissions that the installation access token should have. If `permissions` is not specified, the installation access token will have all of the permissions that were granted to the app. The installation access token cannot be granted permissions that the app was not granted. When using the repository or permission parameters to reduce the access of the token, the complexity of the token is increased due to both the number of permissions in the request and the number of repositories the token will have access to. If the complexity is too large, the token will fail to be issued. If this occurs, the error message will indicate the maximum number of repositories that should be requested. For the average application requesting 8 permissions, this limit is around 5000 repositories. With fewer permissions requested, more repositories are supported.

The `data` key contains an array of files. Each resource in the array is a separate file object and contains the full representation of the file. The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag\/Pagination). #### Filtering You can optionally request that the response only include files that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/nodes\/ezcuj\/files\/osfstorage\/?filter[kind]=file Node files may be filtered by `id`, `name`, `node`, `kind`, `path`, `provider`, `size`, and `last_touched`. ### Waterbutler API actions Files can be modified through the Waterbutler API routes found in `links` (`new_folder`, `move`, `upload`, `download`, and `delete`). #### Download (files) To download a file, issue a GET request against the download link. The response will have the Content-Disposition header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser. #### Create Subfolder (folders) You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the new_folder link. The ?kind=folder portion of the query parameter is already included in the new_folder link. The name of the new subfolder should be provided in the name query parameter. The response will contain a WaterButler folder entity. If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response. #### Upload New File (folders) To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's upload link with the raw file data in the request body, and the kind and name query parameters set to 'file' and the desired name of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the new file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response. #### Update Existing File (file) To update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's upload link with the raw file data in the request body and the kind query parameter set to \"file\". The update action will create a new version of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the updated file. #### Rename (files, folders) To rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the move link with the action body parameter set to \"rename\" and the rename body parameter set to the desired name. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name. #### Move & Copy (files, folders) Move and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the move url, but with different values for the action body parameters. The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file's name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be ' (x)' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name. Files and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file\/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file\/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers. If a moved\/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned. #### Delete (file, folders) To delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the delete link. Nothing will be returned in the response body."}

The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag\/Pagination). This request should never return an error. #### Filtering You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/nodes\/?filter[title]=reproducibility. Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `preprint`, and `contributors`. Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**.

The [OAuth Authorizations API](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/oauth-authorizations\/oauth-authorizations) will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https:\/\/developer.github.com\/changes\/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint\/). **Warning:** Apps must use the [web application flow](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/apps\/building-oauth-apps\/authorizing-oauth-apps\/#web-application-flow) to obtain OAuth tokens that work with GitHub Enterprise Server SAML organizations. OAuth tokens created using the Authorizations API will be unable to access GitHub Enterprise Server SAML organizations. For more information, see the [blog post](https:\/\/developer.github.com\/changes\/2019-11-05-deprecated-passwords-and-authorizations-api). Creates OAuth tokens using [Basic Authentication](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/overview\/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication). If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens. For more information, see \"[Working with two-factor authentication](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/overview\/other-authentication-methods#working-with-two-factor-authentication).\" To create tokens for a particular OAuth application using this endpoint, you must authenticate as the user you want to create an authorization for and provide the app's client ID and secret, found on your OAuth application's settings page. If your OAuth application intends to create multiple tokens for one user, use `fingerprint` to differentiate between them. You can also create tokens on GitHub Enterprise Server from the [personal access tokens settings](https:\/\/github.com\/settings\/tokens) page. Read more about these tokens in [the GitHub Help documentation](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/articles\/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use). Organizations that enforce SAML SSO require personal access tokens to be allowed.

{"source_file":"bitbucket.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: GET | Path: \/repositories\/{workspace}\/{repo_slug}\/src\/{commit}\/{path} | Summary: Get file or directory contents | Tags: Source, Repositories","target_text":"This endpoints is used to retrieve the contents of a single file, or the contents of a directory at a specified revision. #### Raw file contents When `path` points to a file, this endpoint returns the raw contents. The response's Content-Type is derived from the filename extension (not from the contents). The file contents are not processed and no character encoding\/recoding is performed and as a result no character encoding is included as part of the Content-Type. The `Content-Disposition` header will be \"attachment\" to prevent browsers from running executable files. If the file is managed by LFS, then a 301 redirect pointing to Atlassian's media services platform is returned. The response includes an ETag that is based on the contents of the file and its attributes. This means that an empty `__init__.py` always returns the same ETag, regardless on the directory it lives in, or the commit it is on. #### File meta data When the request for a file path includes the query parameter `?format=meta`, instead of returning the file's raw contents, Bitbucket instead returns the JSON object describing the file's properties: ```javascript $ curl https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef\/tests\/__init__.py?format=meta { \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/__init__.py\" }, \"meta\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/__init__.py?format=meta\" } }, \"path\": \"tests\/__init__.py\", \"commit\": { \"type\": \"commit\", \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/commit\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\" }, \"html\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/atlassian\/bbql\/commits\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\" } } }, \"attributes\": [], \"type\": \"commit_file\", \"size\": 0 } ``` File objects contain an `attributes` element that contains a list of possible modifiers. Currently defined values are: * `link` -- indicates that the entry is a symbolic link. The contents of the file represent the path the link points to. * `executable` -- indicates that the file has the executable bit set. * `subrepository` -- indicates that the entry points to a submodule or subrepo. The contents of the file is the SHA1 of the repository pointed to. * `binary` -- indicates whether Bitbucket thinks the file is binary. This endpoint can provide an alternative to how a HEAD request can be used to check for the existence of a file, or a file's size without incurring the overhead of receiving its full contents. #### Directory listings When `path` points to a directory instead of a file, the response is a paginated list of directory and file objects in the same order as the underlying SCM system would return them. For example: ```javascript $ curl https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef\/tests { \"pagelen\": 10, \"values\": [ { \"path\": \"tests\/test_project\", \"type\": \"commit_directory\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/test_project\/\" }, \"meta\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/test_project\/?format=meta\" } }, \"commit\": { \"type\": \"commit\", \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/commit\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\" }, \"html\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/atlassian\/bbql\/commits\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\" } } } }, { \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/__init__.py\" }, \"meta\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/__init__.py?format=meta\" } }, \"path\": \"tests\/__init__.py\", \"commit\": { \"type\": \"commit\", \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/commit\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\" }, \"html\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/atlassian\/bbql\/commits\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\" } } }, \"attributes\": [], \"type\": \"commit_file\", \"size\": 0 } ], \"page\": 1, \"size\": 2 } ``` When listing the contents of the repo's root directory, the use of a trailing slash at the end of the URL is required. The response by default is not recursive, meaning that only the direct contents of a path are returned. The response does not recurse down into subdirectories. In order to \"walk\" the entire directory tree, the client can either parse each response and follow the `self` links of each `commit_directory` object, or can specify a `max_depth` to recurse to. The max_depth parameter will do a breadth-first search to return the contents of the subdirectories up to the depth specified. Breadth-first search was chosen as it leads to the least amount of file system operations for git. If the `max_depth` parameter is specified to be too large, the call will time out and return a 555. Each returned object is either a `commit_file`, or a `commit_directory`, both of which contain a `path` element. This path is the absolute path from the root of the repository. Each object also contains a `commit` object which embeds the commit the file is on. Note that this is merely the commit that was used in the URL. It is *not* the commit that last modified the file. Directory objects have 2 representations. Their `self` link returns the paginated contents of the directory. The `meta` link on the other hand returns the actual `directory` object itself, e.g.: ```javascript { \"path\": \"tests\/test_project\", \"type\": \"commit_directory\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/test_project\/\" }, \"meta\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/test_project\/?format=meta\" } }, \"commit\": { ... } } ``` #### Querying, filtering and sorting Like most API endpoints, this API supports the Bitbucket querying\/filtering syntax and so you could filter a directory listing to only include entries that match certain criteria. For instance, to list all binary files over 1kb use the expression: `size > 1024 and attributes = \"binary\"` which after urlencoding yields the query string: `?q=size%3E1024+and+attributes%3D%22binary%22` To change the ordering of the response, use the `?sort` parameter: `...\/src\/eefd5ef\/?sort=-size` See [filtering and sorting](\/cloud\/bitbucket\/rest\/intro\/#filtering) for more details."}

If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag\/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed. ### Waterbutler API actions Files can be modified through the Waterbutler API routes found in `links` (`new_folder`, `move`, `upload`, `download`, and `delete`). #### Download (files) To download a file, issue a GET request against the download link. The response will have the Content-Disposition header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser. #### Create Subfolder (folders) You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the new_folder link. The ?kind=folder portion of the query parameter is already included in the new_folder link. The name of the new subfolder should be provided in the name query parameter. The response will contain a WaterButler folder entity. If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response. #### Upload New File (folders) To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's upload link with the raw file data in the request body, and the kind and name query parameters set to 'file' and the desired name of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the new file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response. #### Update Existing File (file) To update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's upload link with the raw file data in the request body and the kind query parameter set to \"file\". The update action will create a new version of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the updated file. #### Rename (files, folders) To rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the move link with the action body parameter set to \"rename\" and the rename body parameter set to the desired name. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name. #### Move & Copy (files, folders) Move and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the move url, but with different values for the action body parameters. The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file's name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be ' (x)' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name. Files and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file\/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file\/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers. If a moved\/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned. #### Delete (file, folders) To delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the delete link. Nothing will be returned in the response body."}

For very old analyses this data is not available, and `0` is returned in this field. **Deprecation notice**: The `tool_name` field is deprecated and will, in future, not be included in the response for this endpoint. The example response reflects this change. The tool name can now be found inside the `tool` field.

If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https:\/\/knowledgecenter.zuora.com\/Billing\/Billing_and_Payments\/Invoice_Settlement\/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. Creates a payment in the following scenarios: - A full or partial payment on an invoice or a debit memo - A full or partial payment on several invoices and debit memos - An unapplied payment in the following situations: - You do not know which customer account the payment belongs to. - You know which customer account the payment belongs to, but you do not know which invoice the payment is applied to. - You receive a payment from your customer that exceeds the balance on the invoice. - You receive a payment from your customer before the invoice has been created. - You intend to create a payment without any invoices or debit memos. - A standalone payment. If you only need to create and process an electronic payment in Zuora through a Zuora gateway integration but settle the payment outside of Zuora, you can create a standalone payment. For a standalone payment, you can specify a currency different from the payment currency in the customer account settings. The support for standalone payments is in the Early Adopter phase. If you want to use this feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http:\/\/support.zuora.com\/) to enable it. If you do not know to which customer account the payment belongs, you can create a payment without specifying a customer account. When you create a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo items that the payment will apply to should be less than or equal to 10,000.

It provides convenient marshaling\/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and Int64() accessors. The serialization format is: ::= (Note that may be empty, from the \"\" case in .) ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 ::= | ::= | . | . | . ::= \"+\" | \"-\" ::= | ::= | | ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei (International System of units; See: http:\/\/physics.nist.gov\/cuu\/Units\/binary.html) ::= m | \"\" | k | M | G | T | P | E (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.) ::= \"e\" | \"E\" No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities. When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized. Before serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent\/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that: a. No precision is lost b. No fractional digits will be emitted c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible. The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative. Examples: 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\" Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise. Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.) This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation."}

Specify the file path or directory with the `path` parameter. If you omit the `path` parameter, you will receive the contents of the repository's root directory. This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see \"[Media types](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/using-the-rest-api\/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types).\" - **`application\/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file contents for files and symlinks. - **`application\/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file contents in HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source [Markup library](https:\/\/github.com\/github\/markup). - **`application\/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example, instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects. If the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their \"type\" specified as \"file\". Logically, the value _should_ be \"submodule\". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility purposes](https:\/\/git.io\/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as \"submodule\". If the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink itself. If the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links[\"git\"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links[\"html\"]`) will have null values. **Notes**: - To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/git\/trees#get-a-tree). - This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve more files, use the [Git Trees API](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/git\/trees#get-a-tree). - Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download. - If the requested file's size is: - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported. - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported.

A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`. #### Holder object #### The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is `\"type\": \"group\"`, and the parameter is the group name, `\"parameter\": \"Teams in space administrators\"` and the value is group ID, `\"value\": \"ca85fac0-d974-40ca-a615-7af99c48d24f\"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties: * `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below). * `parameter` As a group's name can change, use of `value` is recommended. The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name. * `value` The value of this property depends on the `type`. If the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group ID. For other `type` it has the same value as `parameter` The following `types` are available. The expected values for `parameter` and `value` are given in parentheses (some types may not have a `parameter` or `value`): * `anyone` Grant for anonymous users. * `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name, application name). See [Update product access settings](https:\/\/confluence.atlassian.com\/x\/3YxjL) for more information. * `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue. * `group` Grant for the specified group (`parameter` : group name, `value` : group ID). * `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID). * `projectLead` Grant for a project lead. * `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (`parameter` :project role ID, `value` : project role ID). * `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue. * `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https:\/\/confluence.atlassian.com\/x\/24dKLg) for more information. * `user` Grant for the specified user (`parameter` : user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used, `value` : user ID). * `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID). #### Built-in permissions #### The [built-in Jira permissions](https:\/\/confluence.atlassian.com\/x\/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https:\/\/developer.atlassian.com\/cloud\/jira\/platform\/modules\/project-permission\/) and [global permission](https:\/\/developer.atlassian.com\/cloud\/jira\/platform\/modules\/global-permission\/) module documentation for more information. **Project permissions** * `ADMINISTER_PROJECTS` * `BROWSE_PROJECTS` * `MANAGE_SPRINTS_PERMISSION` (Jira Software only) * `SERVICEDESK_AGENT` (Jira Service Desk only) * `VIEW_DEV_TOOLS` (Jira Software only) * `VIEW_READONLY_WORKFLOW` **Issue permissions** * `ASSIGNABLE_USER` * `ASSIGN_ISSUES` * `CLOSE_ISSUES` * `CREATE_ISSUES` * `DELETE_ISSUES` * `EDIT_ISSUES` * `LINK_ISSUES` * `MODIFY_REPORTER` * `MOVE_ISSUES` * `RESOLVE_ISSUES` * `SCHEDULE_ISSUES` * `SET_ISSUE_SECURITY` * `TRANSITION_ISSUES` **Voters and watchers permissions** * `MANAGE_WATCHERS` * `VIEW_VOTERS_AND_WATCHERS` **Comments permissions** * `ADD_COMMENTS` * `DELETE_ALL_COMMENTS` * `DELETE_OWN_COMMENTS` * `EDIT_ALL_COMMENTS` * `EDIT_OWN_COMMENTS` **Attachments permissions** * `CREATE_ATTACHMENTS` * `DELETE_ALL_ATTACHMENTS` * `DELETE_OWN_ATTACHMENTS` **Time tracking permissions** * `DELETE_ALL_WORKLOGS` * `DELETE_OWN_WORKLOGS` * `EDIT_ALL_WORKLOGS` * `EDIT_OWN_WORKLOGS` * `WORK_ON_ISSUES` **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira."}

For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/search\/search#text-match-metadata). For example, if you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https:\/\/github.com\/jquery\/jquery) repository, your query would look something like this: `q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery\/jquery` This query searches for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. The query limits the search to files where the language is JavaScript in the `jquery\/jquery` repository. Considerations for code search: Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed: * Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch. * Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable. * You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https:\/\/github.com\/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing language:go`](https:\/\/github.com\/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is."}

The endpoint you call to upload release assets is specific to your release. Use the `upload_url` returned in the response of the [Create a release endpoint](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/releases\/releases#create-a-release) to upload a release asset. You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint. Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https:\/\/www.iana.org\/assignments\/media-types\/media-types.xhtml). For example: `application\/zip` GitHub Enterprise Server expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example, you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset. When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted. **Notes:** * GitHub Enterprise Server renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The \"[List release assets](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/releases\/assets#list-release-assets)\" endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and help, contact [GitHub Enterprise Server Support](https:\/\/support.github.com\/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api). * To find the `release_id` query the [`GET \/repos\/{owner}\/{repo}\/releases\/latest` endpoint](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/releases\/releases#get-the-latest-release). * If you upload an asset with the same filename as another uploaded asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the old file before you can re-upload the new asset."}

{"source_file":"bitbucket.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: POST | Path: \/repositories\/{workspace}\/{repo_slug}\/branch-restrictions | Summary: Create a branch restriction rule | Tags: Branch restrictions","target_text":"Creates a new branch restriction rule for a repository. `kind` describes what will be restricted. Allowed values include: `push`, `force`, `delete` and `restrict_merges`. Different kinds of branch restrictions have different requirements: * `push` and `restrict_merges` require `users` and `groups` to be specified. Empty lists are allowed, in which case permission is denied for everybody. The restriction applies to all branches that match. There are two ways to match a branch. It is configured in `branch_match_kind`: 1. `glob`: Matches a branch against the `pattern`. A `'*'` in `pattern` will expand to match zero or more characters, and every other character matches itself. For example, `'foo*'` will match `'foo'` and `'foobar'`, but not `'barfoo'`. `'*'` will match all branches. 2. `branching_model`: Matches a branch against the repository's branching model. The `branch_type` controls the type of branch to match. Allowed values include: `production`, `development`, `bugfix`, `release`, `feature` and `hotfix`. The combination of `kind` and match must be unique. This means that two `glob` restrictions in a repository cannot have the same `kind` and `pattern`. Additionally, two `branching_model` restrictions in a repository cannot have the same `kind` and `branch_type`. `users` and `groups` are lists of users and groups that are except from the restriction. They can only be configured in `push` and `restrict_merges` restrictions. The `push` restriction stops a user pushing to matching branches unless that user is in `users` or is a member of a group in `groups`. The `restrict_merges` stops a user merging pull requests to matching branches unless that user is in `users` or is a member of a group in `groups`. Adding new users or groups to an existing restriction should be done via `PUT`. Note that branch restrictions with overlapping matchers is allowed, but the resulting behavior may be surprising."}

{"source_file":"github.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: POST | Path: \/repos\/{owner}\/{repo}\/deployments | Summary: Create a deployment | Tags: repos","target_text":"Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults. The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub Enterprise Server we often deploy branches and verify them before we merge a pull request. The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`. The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds, the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will return a failure response. By default, [commit statuses](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/commits\/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success` state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed. The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched. The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an application with debugging enabled. Merged branch response: You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating a deployment. This auto-merge happens when: * Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository * Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example * There are no merge conflicts If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful response. Merge conflict response: This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts. Failed commit status checks: This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success` status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`. OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` or `repo_deployment` scope to use this endpoint."}

You can obtain the IDs of an issue's valid transitions using the `transitions` option in the `expand` parameter of [ Get issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-get). In all these cases, you can pass an account ID to determine if a user can be assigned to an issue. The user is returned in the response if they can be assigned to the issue or issue transition. This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that can be assigned the issue. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who can be assigned the issue, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.

{"source_file":"asana.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: GET | Path: \/workspaces\/{workspace_gid}\/tasks\/search | Summary: Search tasks in a workspace | Tags: Tasks","target_text":"To mirror the functionality of the Asana web app's advanced search feature, the Asana API has a task search endpoint that allows you to build complex filters to find and retrieve the exact data you need. #### Premium access Like the Asana web product's advance search feature, this search endpoint will only be available to premium Asana users. A user is premium if any of the following is true: - The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium workspace - The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace Even if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium workspace, search will allow them to find data anywhere in the workspace, not just inside the premium team. Making a search request using credentials of a non-premium user will result in a `402 Payment Required` error. #### Pagination Search results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times may return the data in a different order, even if the data do not change. Because of this, the traditional [pagination](https:\/\/developers.asana.com\/docs\/#pagination) available elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here. However, you can paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time and then modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have already seen. Page sizes are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can be specified by the `limit` query parameter. #### Eventual consistency Changes in Asana (regardless of whether they’re made though the web product or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be indexed. This process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete under normal operation, and longer during some production incidents. Making a change to a task that would alter its presence in a particular search query will not be reflected immediately. This is also true of the advanced search feature in the web product. #### Rate limits You may receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response if you hit any of our [rate limits](https:\/\/developers.asana.com\/docs\/#rate-limits). #### Custom field parameters | Parameter name | Custom field type | Accepted type | |---|---|---| | custom_fields.{gid}.is_set | All | Boolean | | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Text | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Number | Number | | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Enum | Enum option ID | | custom_fields.{gid}.starts_with | Text only | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.ends_with | Text only | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.contains | Text only | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.less_than | Number only | Number | | custom_fields.{gid}.greater_than | Number only | Number | For example, if the gid of the custom field is 12345, these query parameter to find tasks where it is set would be `custom_fields.12345.is_set=true`. To match an exact value for an enum custom field, use the gid of the desired enum option and not the name of the enum option: `custom_fields.12345.value=67890`. **Not Supported**: searching for multiple exact matches of a custom field, searching for multi-enum custom field *Note: If you specify `projects.any` and `sections.any`, you will receive tasks for the project **and** tasks for the section. If you're looking for only tasks in a section, omit the `projects.any` from the request.*"}

If size of the library exceeds server preferences (normally 500) or the value of the optional limit parameter, the result will be paginated. Paginated responses return a Link header, indicating the next URI to fetch. The resulting header value will look something like: ; rel=\"next\" where limit is number of items in response, and offset is the current position in pagination. The rel-part in the header is the links relation to the data previously recieved. The idea is that as long as this header is present there are still items remaining to be fetched. When either the header is not present or it's value doesn't contain any \"next\" value, all items have been sent to the client. Note: The client should NOT try to extract query parameters from the URI, but rather use it as-is for the next request. Also, clients should be perpared that one Link header might contain multiple other IRIs that are not \"next\" (there will never be more than one \"next\" though). See more at: IETF: https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc5988 GitHub: https:\/\/developer.github.com\/guides\/traversing-with-pagination\/ If eventLogUuid is provided, the response will only include events affecting the library since that event.

The [OAuth Authorizations API](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/oauth-authorizations\/oauth-authorizations) will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https:\/\/developer.github.com\/changes\/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint\/). You can use this API to list the set of OAuth applications that have been granted access to your account. Unlike the [list your authorizations](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/oauth-authorizations\/oauth-authorizations#list-your-authorizations) API, this API does not manage individual tokens. This API will return one entry for each OAuth application that has been granted access to your account, regardless of the number of tokens an application has generated for your user. The list of OAuth applications returned matches what is shown on [the application authorizations settings screen within GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/settings\/applications#authorized). The `scopes` returned are the union of scopes authorized for the application. For example, if an application has one token with `repo` scope and another token with `user` scope, the grant will return `[\"repo\", \"user\"]`."}

A PaymentIntent transitions through [multiple statuses](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/payments\/intents#intent-statuses) throughout its lifetime as it interfaces with Stripe.js to perform authentication flows and ultimately creates at most one successful charge. Related guide: [Payment Intents API](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/payments\/payment-intents)."}

To post a bill run, the current bill run must have a status of `Completed`. When a bill run is posted, its status is changed to `PostInProgress`. Once all invoices for this bill run are posted then its status is changed to `Posted`. When you post a bill run and query the status of a bill run, you will get one of the following results `PostInProgress`, `Completed`, or `Posted`. If all invoices in the bill run are posted, then the status of the bill run is `Posted`. If one or more invoices fail to post, the status will change back to `Completed` and you will need to post the bill run again. ## Cancel a Bill Run Canceling a bill run is an asynchronous operation. When canceling a bill run, the logic is the same as when using the UI to cancel a bill run. You need to provide the `BillRunId`, and set the Status to `Canceled`. When canceling a bill run, consider the following: * Canceling a bill run with a `Completed` status. * Only the current bill run will be canceled. * Canceling a bill run with a `Pending` status. * When canceling an Ad-hoc bill run, only the current bill run will be canceled. * When canceling a scheduled bill, all scheduled bill runs will be canceled. The Cancel operation may not be successful. Its success depends on its current business validation. Only a bill run that has no posted invoices can be canceled. If any posted invoices belong to the bill run then an invalid value exception will be thrown with the message, \"The Bill Run cannot be Cancelled, There are Posted invoices.\""}

In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).

An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role. Actors may be set as [default members](https:\/\/support.atlassian.com\/jira-cloud-administration\/docs\/manage-project-roles\/#Specifying-'default-members'-for-a-project-role) of the project role or set at the project level: * Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects.

In a next-gen project any issue may be made a child providing that the parent and child are members of the same project. **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* and *Create issues* [project permissions](https:\/\/confluence.atlassian.com\/x\/yodKLg) for the project in which the issue or subtask is created."}

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn't have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; \/\/ ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red \/ denominator) .setGreen(green \/ denominator) .setBlue(blue \/ denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) \/ denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } \/\/ ... Example (iOS \/ Obj-C): \/\/ ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha <= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } \/\/ ...

{"source_file":"bitbucket.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: PUT | Path: \/snippets\/{workspace}\/{encoded_id} | Summary: Update a snippet | Tags: Snippets","target_text":"Used to update a snippet. Use this to add and delete files and to change a snippet's title. To update a snippet, one can either PUT a full snapshot, or only the parts that need to be changed. The contract for PUT on this API is that properties missing from the request remain untouched so that snippets can be efficiently manipulated with differential payloads. To delete a property (e.g. the title, or a file), include its name in the request, but omit its value (use `null`). As in Git, explicit renaming of files is not supported. Instead, to rename a file, delete it and add it again under another name. This can be done atomically in a single request. Rename detection is left to the SCM. PUT supports three different content types for both request and response bodies: * `application\/json` * `multipart\/related` * `multipart\/form-data` The content type used for the request body can be different than that used for the response. Content types are specified using standard HTTP headers. Use the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to select the desired request and response format. application\/json ---------------- As with creation and retrieval, the content type determines what properties can be manipulated. `application\/json` does not support file contents and is therefore limited to a snippet's meta data. To update the title, without changing any of its files: $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application\/json\" https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst\/kypj -d '{\"title\": \"Updated title\"}' To delete the title: $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application\/json\" https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst\/kypj -d '{\"title\": null}' Not all parts of a snippet can be manipulated. The owner and creator for instance are immutable. multipart\/related ----------------- `multipart\/related` can be used to manipulate all of a snippet's properties. The body is identical to a POST. properties omitted from the request are left unchanged. Since the `start` part contains JSON, the mechanism for manipulating the snippet's meta data is identical to `application\/json` requests. To update one of a snippet's file contents, while also changing its title: PUT \/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst\/kypj HTTP\/1.1 Content-Length: 288 Content-Type: multipart\/related; start=\"snippet\"; boundary=\"===============1438169132528273974==\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: application\/json; charset=\"utf-8\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-ID: snippet { \"title\": \"My updated snippet\", \"files\": { \"foo.txt\": {} } } --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: text\/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-ID: \"foo.txt\" Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"foo.txt\" Updated file contents. --===============1438169132528273974==-- Here only the parts that are changed are included in the body.
