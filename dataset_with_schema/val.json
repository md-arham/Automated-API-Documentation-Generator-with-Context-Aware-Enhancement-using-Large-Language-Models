You can compare refs (branches or tags) and commit SHAs in the same repository, or you can compare refs and commit SHAs that exist in different repositories within the same repository network, including fork branches. For more information about how to view a repository's network, see \"[Understanding connections between repositories](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/repositories\/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository\/understanding-connections-between-repositories).\" This endpoint is equivalent to running the `git log BASE..HEAD` command, but it returns commits in a different order. The `git log BASE..HEAD` command returns commits in reverse chronological order, whereas the API returns commits in chronological order. This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see \"[Media types](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/using-the-rest-api\/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types).\" - **`application\/vnd.github.diff`**: Returns the diff of the commit. - **`application\/vnd.github.patch`**: Returns the patch of the commit. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property. The API response includes details about the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file. When calling this endpoint without any paging parameter (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits, and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison. **Working with large comparisons** To process a response with a large number of commits, use a query parameter (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using pagination: - The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of results, but it includes all changed files for the entire comparison. - The results are returned in chronological order, but the last commit in the returned list may not be the most recent one in the entire set if there are more pages of results. For more information on working with pagination, see \"[Using pagination in the REST API](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/guides\/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api).\" **Signature verification object** The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The `verification` object includes the following fields: | Name | Type | Description | | ---- | ---- | ----------- | | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. | | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. | | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. | | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. | These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object: | Value | Description | | ----- | ----------- | | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. | | `not_signing_key` | The \"signing\" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. | | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. | | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. | | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. | | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. | | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. | | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. | | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. | | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. | | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. | | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. | | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |"}

You can delete one analysis at a time. To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards. Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor. When you list the analyses for a repository, one or more will be identified as deletable in the response: ``` \"deletable\": true ``` An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses. Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses for each enabled code scanning tool, where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values: * `ref` * `tool` * `category` If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set, you'll get a 400 response with the message: ``` Analysis specified is not deletable. ``` The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set: `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`. Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis for the specified tool in your repository. Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool. When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url` in the 200 response is `null`. As an example of the deletion process, let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses: 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch. You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool. You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool. To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests. To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable. Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable. Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets, delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted. Then repeat the process for the second set. The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop: **Outer loop**: * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool. * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found: **Inner loop**: * Delete the identified analysis. * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration. The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely. OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint with private or public repositories, or the `public_repo` scope to use this endpoint with only public repositories."}

The [OAuth Authorizations API](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/oauth-authorizations\/oauth-authorizations) will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https:\/\/developer.github.com\/changes\/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint\/). **Warning:** Apps must use the [web application flow](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/apps\/building-oauth-apps\/authorizing-oauth-apps\/#web-application-flow) to obtain OAuth tokens that work with GitHub Enterprise Server SAML organizations. OAuth tokens created using the Authorizations API will be unable to access GitHub Enterprise Server SAML organizations. For more information, see the [blog post](https:\/\/developer.github.com\/changes\/2019-11-05-deprecated-passwords-and-authorizations-api). This method will create a new authorization for the specified OAuth application, only if an authorization for that application and fingerprint do not already exist for the user. The URL includes the 20 character client ID for the OAuth app that is requesting the token. `fingerprint` is a unique string to distinguish an authorization from others created for the same client ID and user. It returns the user's existing authorization for the application if one is present. Otherwise, it creates and returns a new one. If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens.

E.g. to get some more information about the repository of matched files (the `%2B` is a URL-encoded `+`): ``` curl 'https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/teams\/team_name\/search\/code'\\ '?search_query=foo&fields=%2Bvalues.file.commit.repository' { \"size\": 1, \"page\": 1, \"pagelen\": 10, \"query_substituted\": false, \"values\": [ { \"type\": \"code_search_result\", \"content_match_count\": 1, \"content_matches\": [...], \"path_matches\": [...], \"file\": { \"commit\": { \"type\": \"commit\", \"hash\": \"ad6964b5fe2880dbd9ddcad1c89000f1dbcbc24b\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/my-workspace\/demo\/commit\/ad6964b5fe2880dbd9ddcad1c89000f1dbcbc24b\" }, \"html\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/my-workspace\/demo\/commits\/ad6964b5fe2880dbd9ddcad1c89000f1dbcbc24b\" } }, \"repository\": { \"name\": \"demo\", \"type\": \"repository\", \"full_name\": \"my-workspace\/demo\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/my-workspace\/demo\" }, \"html\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/my-workspace\/demo\" }, \"avatar\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/bytebucket.org\/ravatar\/%7B850e1749-781a-4115-9316-df39d0600e7a%7D?ts=default\" } }, \"uuid\": \"{850e1749-781a-4115-9316-df39d0600e7a}\" } }, \"type\": \"commit_file\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/my-workspace\/demo\/src\/ad6964b5fe2880dbd9ddcad1c89000f1dbcbc24b\/src\/foo.py\" } }, \"path\": \"src\/foo.py\" } } ] } ``` Try `fields=%2Bvalues.*.*.*.*` to get an idea what's possible."}

For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment. Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow. Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials. Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid. The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/payments\/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides you through the setup process. Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments. For example, cardholders in [certain regions](\/guides\/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through [Strong Customer Authentication](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/payments\/setup-intents). If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success, it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer. We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods. By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of required friction, even as regulations change over time.

This happens when it points at a specific branch that has been deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. It is not possible to update the settings for `development` if that would leave the branch in an invalid state. Such a request will be rejected. The `production` branch can be a specific branch, the main branch or disabled. When set to a specific branch it must currently exist. The `enabled` property can be used to enable (`true`) or disable (`false`) it. Only the passed properties will be updated. The properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a `production` property will leave the production branch unchanged. It is possible for the `production` branch to be invalid. This happens when it points at a specific branch that has been deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. A request that would leave `production` enabled and invalid will be rejected. It is possible to update `production` and make it invalid if it would also be left disabled. The `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be updated. Only the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will be rejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid state. For branch types this means that: 1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For example, it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix. 2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of another enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily classified by its prefix unambiguously. It is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type would be left disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The properties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type must have a `kind` property to identify it.

Add the annotations you want to upload as objects in a JSON array and make sure each annotation has the external_id field set to a unique value. If you want to use an existing id from your own system, we recommend prefixing it with your system's name to avoid collisions, for example, mySystem-annotation001.
