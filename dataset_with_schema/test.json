See [Known Limitations in Orders](https:\/\/knowledgecenter.zuora.com\/BC_Subscription_Management\/Orders\/C_Known_Limitations_in_Orders) for additional limitations. The limit of orders allowed on a subscription is 1000. The limit of order line items allowed in an order is 100. Zuora has the following limits on the Orders synchronous API to prevent performance degradation: * Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call. If you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends you use the following asynchronous API operations: * [Create an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) * [Preview an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) Zuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to prevent performance degradation: * Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. If you have a need for a large order that exceeds any limits of the above, you can request a limit increase for the Orders asynchronous API by submitting a request at [Zuora Global Support](https:\/\/support.zuora.com). **Note:** When you are to suspend a subcription (via the `suspend` order action), if in the same \"Create an order\" call you are to perform other subsequent order actions on the supscription to suspend, you must first resume the subscription (via a `resume` order action). **Note:** When using this operation to create an account, create a subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if any error occurs during the call, such as a payment processing failure and a tax engine failure, then all the other steps will be rolled back. This means that the invoice will not be generated, the subscription will not be created, and the account will not be created."}

You must have the \"Cancel Journal Run\" Zuora Finance user permission enabled to cancel journal runs. ## Notes When you cancel a journal run, the summary journal entries associated with that journal run are canceled asynchronously. A response of `{ \"success\": true }` means only that the specified journal run has a status of \"Pending\", \"Error\", or \"Completed\" and therefore can be canceled, but does not mean that the whole journal run was successfully canceled. For example, let's say you want to cancel journal run JR-00000075. The journal run status is \"Completed\" and it contains ten journal entries. One of the journal entries has its Transferred to Accounting status set to \"Yes\", meaning that the entry cannot be canceled. The workflow might go as follows: 1. You make an API call to cancel the journal run. 2. The journal run status is \"Completed\", so you receive a response of `{ \"success\": true }`. 3. Zuora begins asynchronously canceling journal entries associated with the journal run. The journal entry whose Transferred to Accounting status is \"Yes\" fails to be canceled. The cancelation process continues, and the other journal entries are successfully canceled. 4. The journal run status remains as \"Completed\". The status does not change to \"Canceled\" because the journal run still contains a journey entry that is not canceled."}
