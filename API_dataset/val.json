Additionally, for information on how to record component usage against a subscription, please see the following resources: + [Recording Metered Component Usage](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5404527849997#reporting-metered-component-usage) + [Reporting Prepaid Component Status](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5404527849997#reporting-prepaid-component-status) You may choose to report metered or prepaid usage to Chargify as often as you wish. You may report usage as it happens. You may also report usage periodically, such as each night or once per billing period. If usage events occur in your system very frequently (on the order of thousands of times an hour), it is best to accumulate usage into batches on your side, and then report those batches less frequently, such as daily. This will ensure you remain below any API throttling limits. If your use case requires higher rates of usage reporting, we recommend utilizing Events Based Components. ## Create Usage for Subscription This endpoint allows you to record an instance of metered or prepaid usage for a subscription. The `quantity` from usage for each component is accumulated to the `unit_balance` on the [Component Line Item](.\/b3A6MTQxMDgzNzQ-read-subscription-component) for the subscription. ## Price Point ID usage If you are using price points, for metered and prepaid usage components, Chargify gives you the option to specify a price point in your request. You do not need to specify a price point ID. If a price point is not included, the default price point for the component will be used when the usage is recorded. If an invalid `price_point_id` is submitted, the endpoint will return an error. ## Deducting Usage In the event that you need to reverse a previous usage report or otherwise deduct from the current usage balance, you may provide a negative quantity. Example: Previously recorded: ```json { \"usage\": { \"quantity\": 5000, \"memo\": \"Recording 5000 units\" } } ``` At this point, `unit_balance` would be `5000`. To reduce the balance to `0`, POST the following payload: ```json { \"usage\": { \"quantity\": -5000, \"memo\": \"Deducting 5000 units\" } } ``` The `unit_balance` has a floor of `0`; negative unit balances are never allowed. For example, if the usage balance is 100 and you deduct 200 units, the unit balance would then be `0`, not `-100`. ## FAQ Q. Is it possible to record metered usage for more than one component at a time? A. No. Usage should be reported as one API call per component on a single subscription. For example, to record that a subscriber has sent both an SMS Message and an Email, send an API call for each."}

Payment Profiles house the credit card, ACH (Authorize.Net or Stripe only,) or PayPal (Braintree only,) data for a customer. The payment information is attached to the customer within Chargify, as opposed to the Subscription itself. You must include a customer_id so that Chargify will attach it to the customer entry. If no customer_id is included the API will return a 404. ## Create a Payment Profile for ACH usage If you would like to create a payment method that is a Bank Account applicable for ACH payments use the following: ```json { \"payment_profile\": { \"customer_id\": [Valid-Customer-ID], \"bank_name\": \"Best Bank\", \"bank_routing_number\": \"021000089\", \"bank_account_number\": \"111111111111\", \"bank_account_type\": \"checking\", \"bank_account_holder_type\": \"business\", \"payment_type\": \"bank_account\" } } ``` ## Taxable Subscriptions If your subscriber pays taxes on their purchased product, and you are attempting to create or update the `payment_profile`, complete address information is required. For information on required address formatting to allow your subscriber to be taxed, please see our documentation [here](https:\/\/developers.chargify.com\/docs\/developer-docs\/d2e9e34db740e-signups#taxes) ## Payment Profile Documentation Full documentation on how Payment Profiles operate within Chargify can be located under the following links: + [Subscriber Payment Details](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405212558349-Customers-Reference#customers-reference-0-0) + [Self Service Pages](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5404759627021) (Allows credit card updates by Subscriber) + [Public Signup Pages payment settings](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405267754381-Individual-Page-Settings#credit-card-settings) ## Create a Payment Profile with a Chargify.js token ```json { \"payment_profile\": { \"customer_id\": 1036, \"chargify_token\": \"tok_w68qcpnftyv53jk33jv6wk3w\" } } ``` ## Active Payment Methods Creating a new payment profile for a Customer via the API will not make that Payment Profile current for any of the Customer’s Subscriptions. In order to utilize the payment profile as the default, it must be set as the default payment profile for the subscription or subscription group. ## Requirements Either the full_number, expiration_month, and expiration_year or if you have an existing vault_token from your gateway, that vault_token and the current_vault are required. Passing in the vault_token and current_vault are only allowed when creating a new payment profile. ### Taxable Subscriptions If your subscriber pays taxes on their purchased product, and you are attempting to create or update the `payment_profile`, complete address information is required. For information on required address formatting to allow your subscriber to be taxed, please see our documentation [here](https:\/\/developers.chargify.com\/docs\/developer-docs\/d2e9e34db740e-signups#taxes) ## BraintreeBlue Some merchants use Braintree JavaScript libraries directly and then pass `payment_method_nonce` and\/or `paypal_email` to create a payment profile. This implementation is deprecated and does not handle 3D Secure. Instead, we have provided [Chargify.js](https:\/\/developers.chargify.com\/docs\/developer-docs\/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDI0-overview) which is continuously improved and supports Credit Cards (along with 3D Secure), PayPal and ApplePay payment types. ## GoCardless For more information on GoCardless, please view the following resources: + [Full documentation on GoCardless](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5404501889677) + [Using Chargify.js with GoCardless - minimal example](https:\/\/developers.chargify.com\/docs\/developer-docs\/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDIy-examples#minimal-example-with-direct-debit-gocardless-gateway) + [Using Chargify.js with GoCardless - full example](https:\/\/developers.chargify.com\/docs\/developer-docs\/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDIy-examples#full-example-with-direct-debit-gocardless-gateway) ### GoCardless with Local Bank Details Following examples create customer, bank account and mandate in GoCardless: ```json { \"payment_profile\": { \"customer_id\": \"Valid-Customer-ID\", \"bank_name\": \"Royal Bank of France\", \"bank_account_number\": \"0000000\", \"bank_routing_number\": \"0003\", \"bank_branch_code\": \"00006\", \"payment_type\": \"bank_account\", \"billing_address\": \"20 Place de la Gare\", \"billing_city\": \"Colombes\", \"billing_state\": \"Île-de-France\", \"billing_zip\": \"92700\", \"billing_country\": \"FR\" } } ``` ### GoCardless with IBAN ```json { \"payment_profile\": { \"customer_id\": \"24907598\", \"bank_name\": \"French Bank\", \"bank_iban\": \"FR1420041010050500013M02606\", \"payment_type\": \"bank_account\", \"billing_address\": \"20 Place de la Gare\", \"billing_city\": \"Colombes\", \"billing_state\": \"Île-de-France\", \"billing_zip\": \"92700\", \"billing_country\": \"FR\" } } ``` ### Importing GoCardless If the customer, bank account, and mandate already exist in GoCardless, a payment profile can be created by using the IDs. In order to create masked versions of `bank_account_number` and `bank_routing_number` that are used to display within Chargify Admin UI, you can pass the last four digits for this fields which then will be saved in this form `XXXX[four-provided-digits]`. ```json { \"payment_profile\": { \"customer_id\": \"24907598\", \"customer_vault_token\": [Existing GoCardless Customer ID] \"vault_token\": [Existing GoCardless Mandate ID], \"current_vault\": \"gocardless\", \"bank_name\": \"French Bank\", \"bank_account_number\": [Last Four Of The Existing Account Number or IBAN if applicable], \"bank_routing_number\": [Last Four Of The Existing Routing Number], \"payment_type\": \"bank_account\", \"billing_address\": \"20 Place de la Gare\", \"billing_city\": \"Colombes\", \"billing_state\": \"Île-de-France\", \"billing_zip\": \"92700\", \"billing_country\": \"FR\" } } ``` ## SEPA Direct Debit For more information on Stripe SEPA Direct Debit, please view the following resources: + [Full documentation on Stripe SEPA Direct Debit](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405050826765-Stripe-SEPA-and-BECS-Direct-Debit) + [Using Chargify.js with Stripe Direct Debit - minimal example](https:\/\/developers.chargify.com\/docs\/developer-docs\/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDIy-examples#minimal-example-with-sepa-or-becs-direct-debit-stripe-gateway) + [Using Chargify.js with Stripe Direct Debit - full example](https:\/\/developers.chargify.com\/docs\/developer-docs\/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDIy-examples#full-example-with-sepa-direct-debit-stripe-gateway) ### Stripe SEPA Direct Debit Payment Profiles The following example creates a customer, bank account and mandate in Stripe: ```json { \"payment_profile\": { \"customer_id\": \"24907598\", \"bank_name\": \"Deutsche bank\", \"bank_iban\": \"DE89370400440532013000\", \"payment_type\": \"bank_account\", \"billing_address\": \"Test\", \"billing_city\": \"Berlin\", \"billing_state\": \"Brandenburg\", \"billing_zip\": \"12345\", \"billing_country\": \"DE\" } } ``` ## Stripe BECS Direct Debit For more information on Stripe BECS Direct Debit, please view the following resources: + [Full documentation on Stripe BECS Direct Debit](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405050826765-Stripe-SEPA-and-BECS-Direct-Debit) + [Using Chargify.js with Stripe BECS Direct Debit - minimal example](https:\/\/developers.chargify.com\/docs\/developer-docs\/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDIy-examples#minimal-example-with-sepa-or-becs-direct-debit-stripe-gateway) + [Using Chargify.js with Stripe BECS Direct Debit - full example](https:\/\/developers.chargify.com\/docs\/developer-docs\/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDIy-examples#full-example-with-sepa-direct-debit-stripe-gateway) ### Stripe BECS Direct Debit Payment Profiles The following example creates a customer, bank account and mandate in Stripe: ```json { \"payment_profile\": { \"customer_id\": \"24907598\", \"bank_name\": \"Australian bank\", \"bank_branch_code\": \"000000\", \"bank_account_number\": \"000123456\" \"payment_type\": \"bank_account\", \"billing_address\": \"Test\", \"billing_city\": \"Stony Rise\", \"billing_state\": \"Tasmania\", \"billing_zip\": \"12345\", \"billing_country\": \"AU\" } } ``` ## 3D Secure - Checkout It may happen that a payment needs 3D Secure Authentication when the payment profile is created; this is referred to in our help docs as a [post-authentication flow](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405177432077#psd2-flows-pre-authentication-and-post-authentication). The server returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` in this case with the following response: ```json { \"jsonapi\": { \"version\": \"1.0\" }, \"errors\": [ { \"title\": \"This card requires 3DSecure verification.\", \"detail\": \"This card requires 3D secure authentication. Redirect the customer to the URL from the action_link attribute to authenticate. Attach callback_url param to this URL if you want to be notified about the result of 3D Secure authentication. Attach redirect_url param to this URL if you want to redirect a customer back to your page after 3D Secure authentication. Example: https:\/\/checkout-test.chargifypay.test\/3d-secure\/checkout\/pay_uerzhsxd5uhkbodx5jhvkg6yeu?one_time_token_id=93&callback_url=http:\/\/localhost:4000&redirect_url=https:\/\/yourpage.com will do a POST request to https:\/\/localhost:4000 after credit card is authenticated and will redirect a customer to https:\/\/yourpage.com after 3DS authentication.\", \"links\": { \"action_link\": \"https:\/\/checkout-test.chargifypay.test\/3d-secure\/checkout\/pay_uerzhsxd5uhkbodx5jhvkg6yeu?one_time_token_id=93\" } } ] } ``` To let the customer go through 3D Secure Authentication, they need to be redirected to the URL specified in `action_link`. Optionally, you can specify `callback_url` parameter in the `action_link` URL if you’d like to be notified about the result of 3D Secure Authentication. The `callback_url` will return the following information: - whether the authentication was successful (`success`) - the payment profile ID (`payment_profile_id`) Lastly, you can also specify a `redirect_url` parameter within the `action_link` URL if you’d like to redirect a customer back to your site. It is not possible to use `action_link` in an iframe inside a custom application. You have to redirect the customer directly to the `action_link`, then, to be notified about the result, use `redirect_url` or `callback_url`. The final URL that you send a customer to complete 3D Secure may resemble the following, where the first half is the `action_link` and the second half contains a `redirect_url` and `callback_url`: `https:\/\/checkout-test.chargifypay.test\/3d-secure\/checkout\/pay_uerzhsxd5uhkbodx5jhvkg6yeu?one_time_token_id=93&callback_url=http:\/\/localhost:4000&redirect_url=https:\/\/yourpage.com` ### Example Redirect Flow You may wish to redirect customers to different pages depending on whether their SCA was performed successfully. Here's an example flow to use as a reference: 1. Create a payment profile via API; it requires 3DS 2. You receive a `action_link` in the response. 3. Use this `action_link` to, for example, connect with your internal resources or generate a session_id 4. Include 1 of those attributes inside the `callback_url` and `redirect_url` to be aware which “session” this applies to 5. Redirect the customer to the `action_link` with `callback_url` and `redirect_url` applied 6. After the customer finishes 3DS authentication, we let you know the result by making a request to applied `callback_url`. 7. After that, we redirect the customer to the `redirect_url`; at this point the result of authentication is known 8. Optionally, you can use the applied \"msg\" param in the `redirect_url` to determine whether it was successful or not"}

You can obtain the IDs of an issue's valid transitions using the `transitions` option in the `expand` parameter of [ Get issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-get). In all these cases, you can pass an account ID to determine if a user can be assigned to an issue. The user is returned in the response if they can be assigned to the issue or issue transition.

Use the `upload_url` returned in the response of the [Create a release endpoint](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/releases\/releases#create-a-release) to upload a release asset. You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint. Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https:\/\/www.iana.org\/assignments\/media-types\/media-types.xhtml). For example: `application\/zip` GitHub Enterprise Server expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example, you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset. When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted. **Notes:** * GitHub Enterprise Server renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The \"[List release assets](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/releases\/assets#list-release-assets)\" endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and help, contact [GitHub Enterprise Server Support](https:\/\/support.github.com\/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api). * To find the `release_id` query the [`GET \/repos\/{owner}\/{repo}\/releases\/latest` endpoint](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/releases\/releases#get-the-latest-release). * If you upload an asset with the same filename as another uploaded asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the old file before you can re-upload the new asset."}

If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag\/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed. ### Waterbutler API actions Files can be modified through the Waterbutler API routes found in `links` (`new_folder`, `move`, `upload`, `download`, and `delete`). #### Download (files) To download a file, issue a GET request against the download link. The response will have the Content-Disposition header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser. #### Create Subfolder (folders) You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the new_folder link. The ?kind=folder portion of the query parameter is already included in the new_folder link. The name of the new subfolder should be provided in the name query parameter. The response will contain a WaterButler folder entity. If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response. #### Upload New File (folders) To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's upload link with the raw file data in the request body, and the kind and name query parameters set to 'file' and the desired name of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the new file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response. #### Update Existing File (file) To update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's upload link with the raw file data in the request body and the kind query parameter set to \"file\". The update action will create a new version of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the updated file. #### Rename (files, folders) To rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the move link with the action body parameter set to \"rename\" and the rename body parameter set to the desired name. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name. #### Move & Copy (files, folders) Move and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the move url, but with different values for the action body parameters. The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file's name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be ' (x)' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name. Files and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file\/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file\/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers. If a moved\/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned. #### Delete (file, folders) To delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the delete link. Nothing will be returned in the response body."}

To post a bill run, the current bill run must have a status of `Completed`. When a bill run is posted, its status is changed to `PostInProgress`. Once all invoices for this bill run are posted then its status is changed to `Posted`. When you post a bill run and query the status of a bill run, you will get one of the following results `PostInProgress`, `Completed`, or `Posted`. If all invoices in the bill run are posted, then the status of the bill run is `Posted`. If one or more invoices fail to post, the status will change back to `Completed` and you will need to post the bill run again. ## Cancel a Bill Run Canceling a bill run is an asynchronous operation. When canceling a bill run, the logic is the same as when using the UI to cancel a bill run. You need to provide the `BillRunId`, and set the Status to `Canceled`. When canceling a bill run, consider the following: * Canceling a bill run with a `Completed` status. * Only the current bill run will be canceled. * Canceling a bill run with a `Pending` status. * When canceling an Ad-hoc bill run, only the current bill run will be canceled. * When canceling a scheduled bill, all scheduled bill runs will be canceled. The Cancel operation may not be successful. Its success depends on its current business validation. Only a bill run that has no posted invoices can be canceled. If any posted invoices belong to the bill run then an invalid value exception will be thrown with the message, \"The Bill Run cannot be Cancelled, There are Posted invoices.\""}
