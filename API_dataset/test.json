Learn more about the role of activation in the [Events-Based Billing docs](https:\/\/chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/4407720810907#activating-components-for-subscribers). Use this endpoint to activate an event-based component for a single subscription. Activating an event-based component causes Chargify to bill for events when the subscription is renewed. *Note: it is possible to stream events for a subscription at any time, regardless of component activation status. The activation status only determines if the subscription should be billed for event-based component usage at renewal.*"}

In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications). Project roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions. #### Members and actors #### In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role. Actors may be set as [default members](https:\/\/support.atlassian.com\/jira-cloud-administration\/docs\/manage-project-roles\/#Specifying-'default-members'-for-a-project-role) of the project role or set at the project level: * Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects.

The `development` branch can be configured to a specific branch or to track the main branch. When set to a specific branch it must currently exist. Only the passed properties will be updated. The properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a `development` property will leave the development branch unchanged. It is possible for the `development` branch to be invalid. This happens when it points at a specific branch that has been deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. It is not possible to update the settings for `development` if that would leave the branch in an invalid state. Such a request will be rejected. The `production` branch can be a specific branch, the main branch or disabled. When set to a specific branch it must currently exist. The `enabled` property can be used to enable (`true`) or disable (`false`) it. Only the passed properties will be updated. The properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a `production` property will leave the production branch unchanged. It is possible for the `production` branch to be invalid. This happens when it points at a specific branch that has been deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. A request that would leave `production` enabled and invalid will be rejected. It is possible to update `production` and make it invalid if it would also be left disabled. The `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be updated. Only the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will be rejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid state. For branch types this means that: 1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For example, it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix. 2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of another enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily classified by its prefix unambiguously. It is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type would be left disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The properties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type must have a `kind` property to identify it. Example Body: ``` { \"development\": { \"use_mainbranch\": true }, \"production\": { \"enabled\": true, \"use_mainbranch\": false, \"name\": \"production\" }, \"branch_types\": [ { \"kind\": \"bugfix\", \"enabled\": true, \"prefix\": \"bugfix\/\" }, { \"kind\": \"feature\", \"enabled\": true, \"prefix\": \"feature\/\" }, { \"kind\": \"hotfix\", \"prefix\": \"hotfix\/\" }, { \"kind\": \"release\", \"enabled\": false, } ] } ``` There is currently a side effect when using this API endpoint. If the repository is inheriting branching model settings from its project, updating the branching model for this repository will disable the project setting inheritance. We have deprecated this side effect and will remove it on 1 August 2022."}
