{"source_file":"chargify.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: PUT | Path: \/subscriptions\/{subscription_id}.json | Summary: Update Subscription | Tags: Subscriptions","target_text":"The subscription endpoint allows you to instantly update one or many attributes about a subscription in a single call. ## Update Subscription Payment Method Change the card that your Subscriber uses for their subscription. You can also use this method to simply change the expiration date of the card **if your gateway allows**. Note that partial card updates for **Authorize.Net** are not allowed via this endpoint. The existing Payment Profile must be directly updated instead. You also use this method to change the subscription to a different product by setting a new value for product_handle. A product change can be done in two different ways, **product change** or **delayed product change**. ## Product Change This endpoint may be used to change a subscription's product. The new payment amount is calculated and charged at the normal start of the next period. If you desire complex product changes or prorated upgrades and downgrades instead, please see the documentation on Migrating Subscription Products. To perform a product change, simply set either the `product_handle` or `product_id` attribute to that of a different product from the same site as the subscription. You can also change the price point by passing in either `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle` - otherwise the new product's default price point will be used. ### Delayed Product Change This method also changes the product and\/or price point, and the new payment amount is calculated and charged at the normal start of the next period. This method schedules the product change to happen automatically at the subscription’s next renewal date. To perform a Delayed Product Change, set the `product_handle` attribute as you would in a regular product change, but also set the `product_change_delayed` attribute to `true`. No proration applies in this case. You can also perform a delayed change to the price point by passing in either `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle` **Note: To cancel a delayed product change, set `next_product_id` to an empty string.** ## Billing Date Changes ### Regular Billing Date Changes Send the `next_billing_at` to set the next billing date for the subscription. After that date passes and the subscription is processed, the following billing date will be set according to the subscription's product period. Note that if you pass an invalid date, we will automatically interpret and set the correct date. For example, when February 30 is entered, the next billing will be set to March 2nd in a non-leap year. The server response will not return data under the key\/value pair of `next_billing`. Please view the key\/value pair of `current_period_ends_at` to verify that the `next_billing` date has been changed successfully. ### Snap Day Changes For a subscription using Calendar Billing, setting the next billing date is a bit different. Send the `snap_day` attribute to change the calendar billing date for **a subscription using a product eligible for calendar billing**. Note: If you change the product associated with a subscription that contains a `snap_date` and immediately `READ\/GET` the subscription data, it will still contain evidence of the existing `snap_date`. This is due to the fact that a product change is instantanous and only affects the product associated with a subscription. After the `next_billing` date arrives, the `snap_day` associated with the subscription will return to `null.` Another way of looking at this is that you willl have to wait for the next billing cycle to arrive before the `snap_date` will reset to `null`."}

The response code, 202 Accepted, does not indicate the success or failure of the operation, just that the request has been accepted for processing. The `actions` returned as part of the response's `links` object can be used to check the status of the Droplet create event. ### Create Multiple Droplets Creating multiple Droplets is very similar to creating a single Droplet. Instead of sending `name` as a string, send `names` as an array of strings. A Droplet will be created for each name you send using the associated information. Up to ten Droplets may be created this way at a time. Rather than returning a single Droplet, the response body will contain a JSON array with a key called `droplets`. This will be set to an array of JSON objects, each of which will contain the standard Droplet attributes.

The resulting header value will look something like: ; rel=\"next\" where limit is number of items in response, and offset is the current position in pagination. The rel-part in the header is the links relation to the data previously recieved. The idea is that as long as this header is present there are still items remaining to be fetched. When either the header is not present or it's value doesn't contain any \"next\" value, all items have been sent to the client. Note: The client should NOT try to extract query parameters from the URI, but rather use it as-is for the next request. Also, clients should be perpared that one Link header might contain multiple other IRIs that are not \"next\" (there will never be more than one \"next\" though).

{"source_file":"zuora.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: POST | Path: \/v1\/action\/subscribe | Summary: Subscribe | Tags: Actions","target_text":"This call performs many actions. Use the subscribe call to bundle information required to create at least one new subscription. The call takes in an array of SubscribeRequests. Because it takes an array, you can submit a batch of subscription requests at once. You can create up to 50 different subscriptions in a single subscribe call. This is a combined call that you can use to perform all of the following tasks in a single call: * Create accounts * Create contacts * Create payment methods, including external payment options * Create an invoice for the subscription * Apply the first payment to a subscription ## Object Limits 50 objects are supported in a single call. ## Effective Date If the effective date is in the future, the invoices will not be generated, and there will be no invoice number. ## Subscription Name, Number, and ID ### Subscription Name and Number The subscription name is a unique identifier for the subscription. If you do not specify a value for the name, Zuora will create one automatically. The automatically generated value is known as the subscription number, such as `A-S00000080`. You cannot change the subscription name or number after creating the subscription. * **Subscription name**: The name that you set for the subscription. * **Subscription number**: The value generated by Zuora automatically if you do not specify a subscription name. Both the subscription name and number must be unique. If they are not, an error will occur. ### Subscription ID The subscription ID is a 32-digit ID in the format 4028xxxx. This is also the unique identifier for a subscription. This value is automatically generated by the system and cannot be edited or updated, but it can be queried. One subscription can have only one subscription name or number, but it can have multiple IDs: Each version of a subscription has a different ID. The Subscription object contains the fields `OriginalId` and `PreviousSubscriptionId`. `OriginalId` is the ID for the first version of a subscription. `PreviousSubscriptionId` is the ID of the version created immediately prior to the current version. ## Subscription Preview You can preview invoices that would be generated by the subscribe call. When previewing invoices with the subscribe call, the correspondinig Contract Effective, Service Activation, or Customer Acceptance date is required if the subscription contains a charge with its trigger event being set as `ContractEffectiveDate`, `ServiceActivationDate`, or `CustomerAcceptanceDate`. ## Invoice Subscriptions Separately If you have enabled the invoice subscriptions separately feature, a subscribe call will generate an invoice for each subscription for every subscription where the field `IsInvoiceSeparate` is set to `true`. If the invoice subscriptions separately feature is disabled, a subscribe call will generate a single invoice for all subscriptions. See [Invoicing Subscriptions Separately](https:\/\/knowledgecenter.zuora.com\/BC_Subscription_Management\/Subscriptions\/B_Creating_Subscriptions\/Invoicing_Subscriptions_Separately) for more information. ## Subscriptions and Draft Invoices If a draft invoice that includes charges exists in a customer account, using the subscribe call to create a new subscription and generate an invoice will cause the new subscription to be added to the existing draft invoice. Zuora will then post the invoice. ## When to Use Subscribe and Create Calls You can use either the subscribe call or the create call to create the objects associated with a subscription (accounts, contacts, and so on). There are differences between these calls, however, and some situations are better for one or the other. ### Use the Subscribe Call The subscribe call bundles up all the information you need for a subscription. Use the subscribe call to create new subscriptions when you have all the information you need. Subscribe calls cannot update BillTo, SoldTo, and Account objects. Payment information objects cannot be updated if there is an existing account ID in the call. These objects are not supported in a subscribe call. ### Use the Create Call The create call is more useful when you want to develop in stages. For example, if you want to first create an account, then a contact, and so on. If you do not have all information available, use the create call. To create a subscription, you must activate the account from Draft status to Active by calling the subscribe call."}

Each line item, at a minimum, must include a title, a quantity and a unit price. Example: ```json { \"invoice\": { \"line_items\": [ { \"title\": \"A Product\", \"quantity\": 12, \"unit_price\": \"150.00\" } ] } } ``` ### Catalog items Instead of creating custom products like in above example, You can pass existing items like products, components. ```json { \"invoice\": { \"line_items\": [ { \"product_id\": \"handle:gold-product\", \"quantity\": 2, } ] } } ``` The price for each line item will be calculated as well as a total due amount for the invoice. Multiple line items can be sent. ### Line items types When defining line item, You can choose one of 3 types for one line item: #### Custom item Like in basic behavior example above, You can pass `title` and `unit_price` for custom item. #### Product id Product handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with `product_id`. By default `unit_price` is taken from product's default price point, but can be overwritten by passing `unit_price` or `product_price_point_id`. If `product_id` is used, following fields cannot be used: `title`, `component_id`. #### Component id Component handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with `component_id`. If `component_id` is used, following fields cannot be used: `title`, `product_id`. By default `unit_price` is taken from product's default price point, but can be overwritten by passing `unit_price` or `price_point_id`. At this moment price points are supportted only for quantity based, on\/off and metered components. For prepaid and event based billing components `unit_price` is required. ### Coupons When creating ad hoc invoice, new discounts can be applied in following way: ```json { \"invoice\": { \"line_items\": [ { \"product_id\": \"handle:gold-product\", \"quantity\": 1 } ], \"coupons\": [ { \"code\": \"COUPONCODE\", \"percentage\": 50.0 } ] } } ``` If You want to use existing coupon for discount creation, only `code` and optional `product_family_id` is needed ```json ... \"coupons\": [ { \"code\": \"FREESETUP\", \"product_family_id\": 1 } ] ... ``` ### Coupon options #### Code Coupon `code` will be displayed on invoice discount section. Coupon code can only contain uppercase letters, numbers, and allowed special characters. Lowercase letters will be converted to uppercase. It can be used to select an existing coupon from the catalog, or as an ad hoc coupon when passed with `percentage` or `amount`. #### Percentage Coupon `percentage` can take values from 0 to 100 and up to 4 decimal places. It cannot be used with `amount`. Only for ad hoc coupons, will be ignored if `code` is used to select an existing coupon from the catalog. #### Amount Coupon `amount` takes number value. It cannot be used with `percentage`. Used only when not matching existing coupon by `code`. #### Description Optional `description` will be displayed with coupon `code`. Used only when not matching existing coupon by `code`. #### Product Family id Optional `product_family_id` handle (with handle: prefix) or id is used to match existing coupon within site, when codes are not unique. #### Compounding Strategy Optional `compounding_strategy` for percentage coupons, can take values `compound` or `full-price`. For amount coupons, discounts will be always calculated against the original item price, before other discounts are applied. `compound` strategy: Percentage-based discounts will be calculated against the remaining price, after prior discounts have been calculated. It is set by default. `full-price` strategy: Percentage-based discounts will always be calculated against the original item price, before other discounts are applied. ### Line Item Options #### Period Date Range A custom period date range can be defined for each line item with the `period_range_start` and `period_range_end` parameters. Dates must be sent in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. `period_range_end` must be greater or equal `period_range_start`. #### Taxes The `taxable` parameter can be sent as `true` if taxes should be calculated for a specific line item. For this to work, the site should be configured to use and calculate taxes. Further, if the site uses Avalara for tax calculations, a `tax_code` parameter should also be sent. For existing catalog items: products\/components taxes cannot be overwritten. #### Price Point Price point handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with `price_point_id` for components with `component_id` or `product_price_point_id` for products with `product_id` parameter. If price point is passed `unit_price` cannot be used. It can be used only with catalog items products and components. #### Description Optional `description` parameter, it will overwrite default generated description for line item. ### Invoice Options #### Issue Date By default, invoices will be created with a issue date set to today. `issue_date` parameter can be send to alter that. Only dates in the past can be send. `issue_date` should be send in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. #### Net Terms By default, invoices will be created with a due date matching the date of invoice creation. If a different due date is desired, the `net_terms` parameter can be sent indicating the number of days in advance the due date should be. #### Addresses The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to override the site's defaults. Each address requires to send a `first_name` at a minimum in order to work. Please see below for the details on which parameters can be sent for each address object. #### Memo and Payment Instructions A custom memo can be sent with the `memo` parameter to override the site's default. Likewise, custom payment instructions can be sent with the `payment_instrucions` parameter. #### Status By default, invoices will be created with open status. Possible alternative is `draft`."}

Quantity Based component can then be added and “allocated” for a subscription. When defining Quantity Based component, You can choose one of 2 types: #### Recurring Recurring quantity-based components are used to bill for the number of some unit (think monthly software user licenses or the number of pairs of socks in a box-a-month club). This is most commonly associated with billing for user licenses, number of users, number of employees, etc. #### One-time One-time quantity-based components are used to create ad hoc usage charges that do not recur. For example, at the time of signup, you might want to charge your customer a one-time fee for onboarding or other services. The allocated quantity for one-time quantity-based components immediately gets reset back to zero after the allocation is made.

It returns an array of SaveResults, indicating the success or failure of updating each object. The following information applies to this call: * You cannot pass in null zObjects. * You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time. * All objects must be of the same type. * For each field in each object, you must determine that object's ID. Then populate the fields that you want update with the new information. * Zuora ignores unrecognized fields in update calls. For example, if an optional field is spelled incorrectly or a field that does not exist is specified, Zuora ignores the field and continues to process the call. No error message is returned for unrecognized fields. ## Limitations This call has the following limitations: * A maximum of 50 objects are supported in a single call. * The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. * The default WSDL version for Actions is 79.

Note that this follows simple lexical ordering of the ref names. This can be undesirable as it does apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that tags are sorted [\"v10\", \"v11\", \"v9\"] instead of [\"v9\", \"v10\", \"v11\"]. Sorting can be changed using the ?q= query parameter. When using ?q=name to explicitly sort on ref name, Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical values as numbers instead of strings."}

This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/guides\/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api). When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file **content** and file **path** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/search\/search#text-match-metadata). For example, if you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https:\/\/github.com\/jquery\/jquery) repository, your query would look something like this: `q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery\/jquery` This query searches for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. The query limits the search to files where the language is JavaScript in the `jquery\/jquery` repository. Considerations for code search: Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed: * Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch. * Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable. * You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https:\/\/github.com\/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing language:go`](https:\/\/github.com\/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is."}

The `git log BASE..HEAD` command returns commits in reverse chronological order, whereas the API returns commits in chronological order. This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see \"[Media types](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/using-the-rest-api\/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types).\" - **`application\/vnd.github.diff`**: Returns the diff of the commit. - **`application\/vnd.github.patch`**: Returns the patch of the commit. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property. The API response includes details about the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file. When calling this endpoint without any paging parameter (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits, and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison. **Working with large comparisons** To process a response with a large number of commits, use a query parameter (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using pagination: - The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of results, but it includes all changed files for the entire comparison. - The results are returned in chronological order, but the last commit in the returned list may not be the most recent one in the entire set if there are more pages of results.

A response of `{ \"success\": true }` means only that the specified journal run has a status of \"Pending\", \"Error\", or \"Completed\" and therefore can be canceled, but does not mean that the whole journal run was successfully canceled. For example, let's say you want to cancel journal run JR-00000075. The journal run status is \"Completed\" and it contains ten journal entries. One of the journal entries has its Transferred to Accounting status set to \"Yes\", meaning that the entry cannot be canceled. The workflow might go as follows: 1. You make an API call to cancel the journal run. 2. The journal run status is \"Completed\", so you receive a response of `{ \"success\": true }`. 3. Zuora begins asynchronously canceling journal entries associated with the journal run. The journal entry whose Transferred to Accounting status is \"Yes\" fails to be canceled. The cancelation process continues, and the other journal entries are successfully canceled. 4. The journal run status remains as \"Completed\". The status does not change to \"Canceled\" because the journal run still contains a journey entry that is not canceled."}

Allowed values include: `push`, `force`, `delete` and `restrict_merges`. Different kinds of branch restrictions have different requirements: * `push` and `restrict_merges` require `users` and `groups` to be specified. Empty lists are allowed, in which case permission is denied for everybody. The restriction applies to all branches that match. There are two ways to match a branch. It is configured in `branch_match_kind`: 1. `glob`: Matches a branch against the `pattern`. A `'*'` in `pattern` will expand to match zero or more characters, and every other character matches itself. For example, `'foo*'` will match `'foo'` and `'foobar'`, but not `'barfoo'`. `'*'` will match all branches. 2. `branching_model`: Matches a branch against the repository's branching model. The `branch_type` controls the type of branch to match. Allowed values include: `production`, `development`, `bugfix`, `release`, `feature` and `hotfix`. The combination of `kind` and match must be unique. This means that two `glob` restrictions in a repository cannot have the same `kind` and `pattern`. Additionally, two `branching_model` restrictions in a repository cannot have the same `kind` and `branch_type`. `users` and `groups` are lists of users and groups that are except from the restriction. They can only be configured in `push` and `restrict_merges` restrictions. The `push` restriction stops a user pushing to matching branches unless that user is in `users` or is a member of a group in `groups`. The `restrict_merges` stops a user merging pull requests to matching branches unless that user is in `users` or is a member of a group in `groups`. Adding new users or groups to an existing restriction should be done via `PUT`. Note that branch restrictions with overlapping matchers is allowed, but the resulting behavior may be surprising."}

Credit card details may be required, depending on the options for the Product being subscribed ([see Product Options](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405246782221#payment-method-settings)). The product may be specified by `product_id` or by `product_handle` (API Handle). In similar fashion, to pass a particular product price point, you may either use `product_price_point_handle` or `product_price_point_id`. An existing customer may be specified by a `customer_id` (ID within Chargify) or a `customer_reference` (unique value within your app that you have shared with Chargify via the reference attribute on a customer). You may also pass in an existing payment profile for that customer with `payment_profile_id`. A new customer may be created by providing `customer_attributes`. Credit card details may be required, depending on the options for the product being subscribed. The product can be specified by `product_id` or by `product_handle` (API Handle). If you are creating a subscription with a payment profile, the attribute to send will be `credit_card_attributes` or `bank_account_attributes` for ACH and Direct Debit. That said, when you read the subscription after creation, we return the profile details under `credit_card` or `bank_account`. ## Taxable Subscriptions If your intent is to charge your subscribers tax via [Avalara Taxes](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405275711885-Avalara-VAT-Tax) or [Custom Taxes](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405069041549-Custom-Taxes), there are a few considerations to be made regarding collecting subscription data. For subscribers to be eligible to be taxed, the following information for the `customer` object or `payment_profile` object must by supplied: + A subscription to a [taxable product](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405246782221-Product-Editing#tax-settings) + [Full valid billing or shipping address](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405356114317#full-address-required-for-taxable-subscriptions) to identify the tax locale + The portion of the address that houses the [state information](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405356114317#required-state-format-for-taxable-subscriptions) of either adddress must adhere to the ISO standard of a 2-3 character limit\/format. + The portion of the address that houses the [country information](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405356114317#required-country-format-for-taxable-subscriptions) must adhere to the ISO standard of a 2 character limit\/format. ## Subscription Request Examples The subscription examples below will be split into two sections. The first section, \"Subscription Customization\", will focus on passing different information with a subscription, such as components, calendar billing, and custom fields. These examples will presume you are using a secure `chargify_token` generated by Chargify.js. The second section, \"Passing Payment Information\", will focus on passing payment information into Chargify. Please be aware that collecting and sending Chargify raw card details requires PCI compliance on your end; these examples are provided as guidance. If your business is not PCI compliant, we recommend using Chargify.js to collect credit cards or bank accounts. # Subscription Customization ## With Components Different components require slightly different data. For example, quantity-based and on\/off components accept `allocated_quantity`, while metered components accept `unit_balance`. When creating a subscription with a component, a `price_point_id` can be passed in along with the `component_id` to specify which price point to use. If not passed in, the default price point will be used. Note: if an invalid `price_point_id` is used, the subscription will still proceed but will use the component's default price point. Components and their price points may be added by ID or by handle. See the example request body labeled \"Components By Handle (Quantity-Based)\"; the format will be the same for other component types. ## With Coupon(s) Pass an array of `coupon_codes`. See the example request body \"With Coupon\". ## With Manual Invoice Collection The `invoice` collection method works only on legacy Statement Architecture. On Relationship Invoicing Architecture use the `remittance` collection method. ## Prepaid Subscription A prepaid subscription can be created with the usual subscription creation parameters, specifying `prepaid` as the `payment_collection_method` and including a nested `prepaid_configuration`. After a prepaid subscription has been created, additional funds can be manually added to the prepayment account through the [Create Prepayment Endpoint](https:\/\/developers.chargify.com\/docs\/api-docs\/7ec482de77ba7-create-prepayment). Prepaid subscriptions do not work on legacy Statement Architecture. ## With Metafields Metafields can either attach to subscriptions or customers. Metafields are popuplated with the supplied metadata to the resource specified. If the metafield doesn't exist yet, it will be created on-the-fly. ## With Custom Pricing Custom pricing is pricing specific to the subscription in question. Create a subscription with custom pricing by passing pricing information instead of a price point. For a custom priced product, pass the custom_price object in place of `product_price_point_id`. For a custom priced component, pass the `custom_price` object within the component object. Custom prices and price points can exist in harmony on a subscription. # Passing Payment Information ## Subscription with Chargify.js token The `chargify_token` can be obtained using [chargify.js](https:\/\/developers.chargify.com\/docs\/developer-docs\/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDI0-overview). The token represents payment profile attributes that were provided by the customer in their browser and stored at the payment gateway. The `payment_type` attribute may either be `credit_card` or `bank_account`, depending on the type of payment method being added. If a bank account is being passed, the payment attributes should be changed to `bank_account_attributes`. ```json { \"subscription\": { \"product_handle\": \"pro-plan\", \"customer_attributes\": { \"first_name\": \"Joe\", \"last_name\": \"Smith\", \"email\": \"j.smith@example.com\" }, \"credit_card_attributes\": { \"chargify_token\": \"tok_cwhvpfcnbtgkd8nfkzf9dnjn\", \"payment_type\": \"credit_card\" } } } ``` ## Subscription with vault token If you already have a customer and card stored in your payment gateway, you may create a subscription with a `vault_token`. Providing the last_four, card type and expiration date will allow the card to be displayed properly in the Chargify UI. ```json { \"subscription\": { \"product_handle\": \"pro-plan\", \"customer_attributes\": { \"first_name\": \"Joe\", \"last_name\": \"Smith\", \"email\": \"j.smith@example.com\" }, \"credit_card_attributes\": { first_name: \"Joe, last_name: \"Smith\", card_type: \"visa\", expiration_month: \"05\", expiration_year: \"2025\", last_four: \"1234\", vault_token: \"12345abc\", current_vault: \"braintree_blue\" } } ``` ## Subscription with Credit Card ```json \"subscription\": { \"product_handle\": \"basic\", \"customer_attributes\": { \"first_name\": \"Joe\", \"last_name\": \"Blow\", \"email\": \"joe@example.com\", \"zip\": \"02120\", \"state\": \"MA\", \"reference\": \"XYZ\", \"phone\": \"(617) 111 - 0000\", \"organization\": \"Acme\", \"country\": \"US\", \"city\": \"Boston\", \"address_2\": null, \"address\": \"123 Mass Ave.\" }, \"credit_card_attributes\": { \"last_name\": \"Smith\", \"first_name\": \"Joe\", \"full_number\": \"4111111111111111\", \"expiration_year\": \"2021\", \"expiration_month\": \"1\", \"card_type\": \"visa\", \"billing_zip\": \"02120\", \"billing_state\": \"MA\", \"billing_country\": \"US\", \"billing_city\": \"Boston\", \"billing_address_2\": null, \"billing_address\": \"123 Mass Ave.\" } } ``` ## Subscription with ACH as Payment Profile ```json { \"subscription\": { \"product_handle\": \"gold-product\", \"customer_attributes\": { \"first_name\": \"Joe\", \"last_name\": \"Blow\", \"email\": \"joe@example.com\", \"zip\": \"02120\", \"state\": \"MA\", \"reference\": \"XYZ\", \"phone\": \"(617) 111 - 0000\", \"organization\": \"Acme\", \"country\": \"US\", \"city\": \"Boston\", \"address_2\": null, \"address\": \"123 Mass Ave.\" }, \"bank_account_attributes\": { \"bank_name\": \"Best Bank\", \"bank_routing_number\": \"021000089\", \"bank_account_number\": \"111111111111\", \"bank_account_type\": \"checking\", \"bank_account_holder_type\": \"business\", \"payment_type\": \"bank_account\" } } } ``` ## Subscription with PayPal payment profile ### With the nonce from Braintree JS ```json { \"subscription\": { \"product_handle\":\"test-product-b\", \"customer_attributes\": { \"first_name\":\"Amelia\", \"last_name\":\"Johnson\", \"email\":\"amelia@example.com\", \"organization\":\"My Awesome Company\" }, \"payment_profile_attributes\":{ \"paypal_email\": \"amelia@example.com\", \"current_vault\": \"braintree_blue\", \"payment_method_nonce\":\"abc123\", \"payment_type\":\"paypal_account\" } } ``` ### With the Braintree Customer ID as the vault token: ```json { \"subscription\": { \"product_handle\":\"test-product-b\", \"customer_attributes\": { \"first_name\":\"Amelia\", \"last_name\":\"Johnson\", \"email\":\"amelia@example.com\", \"organization\":\"My Awesome Company\" }, \"payment_profile_attributes\":{ \"paypal_email\": \"amelia@example.com\", \"current_vault\": \"braintree_blue\", \"vault_token\":\"58271347\", \"payment_type\":\"paypal_account\" } } ``` ## Subscription using GoCardless Bank Number These examples creates a customer, bank account and mandate in GoCardless.

Optionally, you can specify `callback_url` parameter in the `action_link` URL if you’d like to be notified about the result of 3D Secure Authentication. The `callback_url` will return the following information: - whether the authentication was successful (`success`) - the gateway ID for the payment (`gateway_payment_id`) - the subscription ID (`subscription_id`) Lastly, you can also specify a `redirect_url` within the `action_link` URL if you’d like to redirect a customer back to your site. It is not possible to use `action_link` in an iframe inside a custom application. You have to redirect the customer directly to the `action_link`, then, to be notified about the result, use `redirect_url` or `callback_url`. The final URL that you send a customer to to complete 3D Secure may resemble the following, where the first half is the `action_link` and the second half contains a `redirect_url` and `callback_url`: `https:\/\/mysite.chargify.com\/3d-secure\/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?one_time_token_id=128&callback_url=https:\/\/localhost:4000&redirect_url=https:\/\/yourpage.com` ## 3D Secure - Checkout It may happen that a payment needs 3D Secure Authentication when the subscription is created; this is referred to in our help docs as a [post-authentication flow](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405177432077#psd2-flows-pre-authentication-and-post-authentication).

Here's an example flow to use as a reference: 1. Create a subscription via API; it requires 3DS 2. You receive a `gateway_payment_id` in the `action_link` along other params in the response. 3. Use this `gateway_payment_id` to, for example, connect with your internal resources or generate a session_id 4. Include 1 of those attributes inside the `callback_url` and `redirect_url` to be aware which “session” this applies to 5. Redirect the customer to the `action_link` with `callback_url` and `redirect_url` applied 6. After the customer finishes 3DS authentication, we let you know the result by making a request to applied `callback_url`. 7. After that, we redirect the customer to the `redirect_url`; at this point the result of authentication is known 8. Optionally, you can use the applied \"msg\" param in the `redirect_url` to determine whether it was successful or not ## Subscriptions Import Subscriptions can be “imported” via the API to handle the following scenarios: + You already have existing subscriptions with specific start and renewal dates that you would like to import to Chargify + You already have credit cards stored in your provider’s vault and you would like to create subscriptions using those tokens Before importing, you should have already set up your products to match your offerings. Then, you can create Subscriptions via the API just like you normally would, but using a few special attributes. Full documentation on how import Subscriptions using the **import tool** in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5404863655821#imports-0-0). ### Important Notices and Disclaimers regarding Imports Before performing a bulk import of subscriptions via the API, we suggest reading the [Subscriptions Import](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5404863655821#important-notices-and-disclaimers) instructions to understand the repurcussions of a large import. ### Subscription Input Attributes The following _additional_ attributes to the subscription input attributes make imports possible: `next_billing_at`, `previous_billing_at`, and `import_mrr`. ### Current Vault If you are using a Legacy gateway such as \"eWAY Rapid (Legacy)\" or \"Stripe (Legacy)\" then please contact Support for further instructions on subscription imports. ### Braintree Blue (Braintree v2) Imports Braintree Blue is Braintree’s newer (version 2) API. For this gateway, please provide the `vault_token` parameter with the value from Braintree’s “Customer ID” rather than the “Payment Profile Token”. At this time we do not use `current_vault_token` with the Braintree Blue gateway, and we only support a single payment profile per Braintree Customer. When importing PayPal type payment profiles, please set `payment_type` to `paypal_account`. ### Stripe ACH Imports If the bank account has already been verified, currently you will need to create the customer, create the payment profile in Chargify - setting verified=true, then create a subscription using the customer_id and payment_profile_id. ### Webhooks During Import If no `next_billing_at` is provided, webhooks will be fired as normal. If you do set a future `next_billing_at`, only a subset of the webhooks are fired when the subscription is created. Keep reading for more information as to what webhooks will be fired under which scenarios. #### Successful creation with Billing Date Scenario: If `next_billing_at` provided + `signup_success` + `billing_date_change` #### Successful creation without Billing Date Scenario: If no `next_billing_at` provided + `signup_success` + `payment_success` #### Unsuccessful creation Scenario: If card can’t be charged, and no `next_billing_at` provided + signup_failure #### Webhooks fired when next_billing_at is reached: + `renewal_success or renewal_failure` + `payment_success or payment_failure` ### Date and Time Formats We will attempt to parse any string you send as the value of next_billing_at in to a date or time. For best results, use a known format like described in “Date and Time Specification” of RFC 2822 or ISO 8601 . The following are all equivalent and will work as input to `next_billing_at`: ``` Aug 06 2030 11:34:00 -0400 Aug 06 2030 11:34 -0400 2030-08-06T11:34:00-04:00 8\/6\/2030 11:34:00 EDT 8\/6\/2030 8:34:00 PDT 2030-08-06T15:34:00Z ``` You may also pass just a date, in which case we will assume the time to be noon ``` 2010-08-06 ``` ## Subscription Hierarchies & WhoPays When subscription groups were first added to our Relationship Invoicing architecture, to group together invoices for related subscriptions and allow for complex customer hierarchies and WhoPays scenarios, they were designed to consist of a primary and a collection of group members. The primary would control many aspects of the group, such as when the consolidated invoice is generated. As of today, groups still function this way. In the future, the concept of a \"primary\" will be removed in order to offer more flexibility into group management and reduce confusion concerning what actions must be done on a primary level, rather than a member level. We have introduced a two scheme system as a bridge between these two group organizations. Scheme 1, which is relevant to all subscription groups today, marks the group as being \"ruled\" by a primary. When reading a subscription via API, they will return a top-level attribute called `group`, which will denote which scheme is being used. At this time, the `scheme` attribute will always be 1. ### Subscription in a Customer Hierarchy For sites making use of the [Relationship Billing](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405078794253-Introduction-to-Invoices) and [Customer Hierarchy](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5404900384141) features, it is possible to create subscriptions within a customer hierarchy. This can be achieved through the API by passing group parameters in the **Create Subscription** request. + The `group` parameters are optional and consist of the required `target` and optional `billing` parameters. When the `target` parameter specifies a customer that is already part of a hierarchy, the new subscription will become a member of the customer hierarchy as well. If the target customer is not part of a hierarchy, a new customer hierarchy will be created and both the target customer and the new subscription will become part of the hierarchy with the specified target customer set as the responsible payer for the hierarchy's subscriptions. Rather than specifying a customer, the `target` parameter could instead simply have a value of `self` which indicates the subscription will be paid for not by some other customer, but by the subscribing customer. This will be true whether the customer is being created new, is already part of a hierarchy, or already exists outside a hierarchy. A valid payment method must also be specified in the subscription parameters. Note that when creating subscriptions in a customer hierarchy, if the customer hierarchy does not already have a payment method, passing valid credit card attributes in the subscription parameters will also result in the payment method being established as the default payment method for the customer hierarchy irrespective of the responsible payer. The optional `billing` parameters specify how some aspects of the billing for the new subscription should be handled. Rather than capturing payment immediately, the `accrue` parameter can be included so that the new subscription charges accrue until the next assessment date. Regarding the date, the `align_date` parameter can be included so that the billing date of the new subscription matches up with the default subscription group in the customer hierarchy. When choosing to align the dates, the `prorate` parameter can also be specified so that the new subscription charges are prorated based on the billing period of the default subscription group in the customer hierarchy also. ### Subscription in a Subscription Group For sites making use of [Relationship Billing](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405078794253-Introduction-to-Invoices) it may be desireable to create a subscription as part of a [subscription group](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405577356173) in order to rely on [invoice consolidation](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5404980119949). This can be achieved through the API by passing group parameters in the Create Subscription request. The `group` parameters are optional and consist of the required `target` and optional `billing` parameters. The `target` parameters specify an existing subscription with which the newly created subscription should be grouped. If the target subscription is already part of a group, the new subscription will become a member of the group as well. If the target subscription is not part of a group, a new group will be created and both the target and the new subscription will become part of the group with the target as the group's primary subscription. The optional `billing` parameters specify how some aspects of the billing for the new subscription should be handled. Rather than capturing payment immediately, the `accrue` parameter can be included so that the new subscription charges accrue until the next assessment date. Regarding the date, the `align_date` parameter can be included so that the billing date of the new subscription matches up with the target subscription. When choosing to align the dates, the `prorate` parameter can also be specified so that the new subscription charges are prorated based on the billing period of the target subscription also. ## Providing Agreement Acceptance Params It is possible to provide a proof of customer's acceptance of terms and policies. We will be storing this proof in case it might be required (i.e. chargeback). Currently, we already keep it for subscriptions created via Public Signup Pages. In order to create a subscription with the proof of agreement acceptance, you must provide additional parameters `agreement acceptance` with `ip_address` and at least one url to the policy that was accepted: `terms_url` or `privacy_policy_url`. Additional urls that can be provided: `return_refund_policy_url`, `delivery_policy_url` and `secure_checkout_policy_url`. ```json \"subscription\": { \"product_handle\": \"gold-product\", \"customer_attributes\": { \"first_name\": \"Jane\", \"last_name\": \"Doe\", \"email\": \"jd@chargify.test\" }, \"agreement_acceptance\": { \"ip_address\": \"1.2.3.4\", \"terms_url\": \"https:\/\/terms.url\", \"privacy_policy_url\": \"https:\/\/privacy_policy.url\", \"return_refund_policy_url\": \"https:\/\/return_refund_policy.url\", \"delivery_policy_url\": \"https:\/\/delivery_policy.url\", \"secure_checkout_policy_url\": \"https:\/\/secure_checkout_policy.url\" } } } ``` **For Maxio Payments subscriptions, the agreement acceptance params are required, with at least terms_url provided.** ## Providing ACH Agreement params It is also possible to provide a proof that a customer authorized ACH agreement terms. The proof will be stored and the email will be sent to the customer with a copy of the terms (if enabled). In order to create a subscription with the proof of authorized ACH agreement terms, you must provide the additional parameter `ach_agreement` with the following nested parameters: `agreement_terms`, `authorizer_first_name`, `authorizer_last_name` and `ip_address`. Each of them is required. ```json \"subscription\": { \"product_handle\": \"gold-product\", \"customer_attributes\": { \"first_name\": \"Jane\", \"last_name\": \"Doe\", \"email\": \"jd@chargify.test\" }, \"bank_account_attributes\": { \"bank_name\": \"Test Bank\", \"bank_routing_number\": \"021000089\", \"bank_account_number\": \"111111111111\", \"bank_account_type\": \"checking\", \"bank_account_holder_type\": \"business\", \"payment_type\": \"bank_account\" }, \"ach_agreement\": { \"agreement_terms\": \"ACH agreement terms\", \"authorizer_first_name\": \"Jane\", \"authorizer_last_name\": \"Doe\", \"ip_address\": \"1.2.3.4\" } } ```"}

Renewal Preview is an object representing a subscription’s next assessment. You can retrieve it to see a snapshot of how much your customer will be charged on their next renewal. The \"Next Billing\" amount and \"Next Billing\" date are already represented in the UI on each Subscriber's Summary. For more information, please see our documentation [here](https:\/\/chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/4407884887835#next-billing). ## Optional Component Fields This endpoint is particularly useful due to the fact that it will return the computed billing amount for the base product and the components which are in use by a subscriber. By default, the preview will include billing details for all components _at their **current** quantities_. This means: * Current `allocated_quantity` for quantity-based components * Current enabled\/disabled status for on\/off components * Current metered usage `unit_balance` for metered components * Current metric quantity value for events recorded thus far for events-based components In the above statements, \"current\" means the quantity or value as of the call to the renewal preview endpoint. We do not predict end-of-period values for components, so metered or events-based usage may be less than it will eventually be at the end of the period. Optionally, **you may provide your own custom quantities** for any component to see a billing preview for non-current quantities. This is accomplished by sending a request body with data under the `components` key. See the request body documentation below. ## Subscription Side Effects You can request a `POST` to obtain this data from the endpoint without any side effects. Plain and simple, this will preview data, not log any changes against a subscription."}

{"source_file":"github.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: GET | Path: \/repos\/{owner}\/{repo}\/pulls\/{pull_number} | Summary: Get a pull request | Tags: pulls","target_text":"Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, GitHub Pro, and legacy per-repository billing plans, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/github\/getting-started-with-github\/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation. Lists details of a pull request by providing its number. When you get, [create](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/pulls\/pulls\/#create-a-pull-request), or [edit](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/pulls\/pulls#update-a-pull-request) a pull request, GitHub Enterprise Server creates a merge commit to test whether the pull request can be automatically merged into the base branch. This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the `mergeable` key. For more information, see \"[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/guides\/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)\". The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub Enterprise Server has started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute in the response. If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. The value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on the state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. After merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on how you merged the pull request: * If merged as a [merge commit](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/articles\/about-merge-methods-on-github\/), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit. * If merged via a [squash](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/articles\/about-merge-methods-on-github\/#squashing-your-merge-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base branch. * If [rebased](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/articles\/about-merge-methods-on-github\/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.

You can use this endpoint to enable Billing Portal access for a Customer, with the option of sending the Customer an Invitation email at the same time. ## Billing Portal Security If your customer has been invited to the Billing Portal, then they will receive a link to manage their subscription (the “Management URL”) automatically at the bottom of their statements, invoices, and receipts. **This link changes periodically for security and is only valid for 65 days.** If you need to provide your customer their Management URL through other means, you can retrieve it via the API. Because the URL is cryptographically signed with a timestamp, it is not possible for merchants to generate the URL without requesting it from Chargify. In order to prevent abuse & overuse, we ask that you request a new URL only when absolutely necessary. Management URLs are good for 65 days, so you should re-use a previously generated one as much as possible.

{"source_file":"zuora.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: POST | Path: \/v1\/usage | Summary: Upload a usage file | Tags: Usage","target_text":"This REST API reference describes how to post or import usage data for one or more accounts in the CSV format. There are no path or query parameters. The data is uploaded using the HTTP multipart\/form-data POST method and applied to the user's tenant. For a use case of this operation, see [Upload usage records](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-guides\/#Upload-usage-records). ## How this REST API Call Works The content of the uploaded usage file must follow the format used by the UI import tool. It must be a comma-separated (CSV) file with a corresponding .csv extension. The length of the file name must not exceed 50 characters. The file size must not exceed 4MB. See [Downloading the Usage Template](https:\/\/knowledgecenter.zuora.com\/CB_Billing\/J_Billing_Operations\/Usage\/C_Import_Usage_Data#Downloading_the_Usage_Template) to learn about how to download the usage file template. At the completion of the upload, before the file contents are actually being processed, the API returns a response containing the byte count of the received file and a URL for checking the status of the import process. Of the five possible results displayed at that URL (Pending, Processing, Completed, Canceled, and Failed) only a Completed status indicates that the import was successful. The operation is atomic; if any record fails, the file is rejected. In that case, the entire import is rolled back and all stored data is returned to its original state. To view the actual import status, enter the resulting status URL from the checkImportStatus response using a tool such as POSTMAN. This additional step provides more information about why the import has failed. To manage the information after a successful upload, use the web-based UI. ## Usage File Format The usage file uses the following headings: | Heading | Description | Required | |-----------------|--------|----------| | ACCOUNT_ID | Enter the account number, e.g., the default account number, such as A00000001, or your custom account number. Although this field is labeled as Account_Id, it is not the actual Account ID nor Account Name. | Yes | | UOM | Enter the unit of measure. This must match the UOM for the usage. | Yes | | QTY | Enter the quantity. | Yes | | STARTDATE | Enter the start date of the usage. This date determines the invoice item service period the associated usage is billed to. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM\/DD\/YYYY`. | Yes | | ENDDATE | Enter the end date of the usage. This is not used in calculations for usage billing and is optional. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM\/DD\/YYYY`. **Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required. | No | | SUBSCRIPTION_ID | Enter the subscription number or subscription name. If you created the subscription in the Zuora application, Zuora created a number automatically in a format similar to A-S00000001. If you do not provide a value for this field, the associated usage will be added to all subscriptions for the specified Account that use this Unit Of Measure. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record. **Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required. | No | | CHARGE_ID | Enter the charge number (not the charge name). You can see the charge ID, e.g., C-00000001, when you add your rate plan to your subscription and view your individual charges. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the specific Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record. This field is related to the Charge Number on the subscription rate plan. **Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required. | No | | DESCRIPTION | Enter a description for the charge. | No |"}

{"source_file":"plaid.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: POST | Path: \/transactions\/sync | Summary: Get incremental transaction updates on an Item | Tags: plaid","target_text":"This endpoint replaces `\/transactions\/get` and its associated webhooks for most common use-cases. The `\/transactions\/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with an Item and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen. `\/transactions\/sync` provides the same functionality as `\/transactions\/get` and can be used instead of `\/transactions\/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates. This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `\/investments\/transactions\/get` instead. Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API. In the first call to `\/transactions\/sync` for an Item, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that Item up until the time of the API call (as \"adds\"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that Item. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call. Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `\/transactions\/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`. When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `\/transactions\/sync` fails when retrieving a paginated update, which can occur as a result of the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https:\/\/plaid.com\/docs\/errors\/transactions\/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed. Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `\/transactions\/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `\/transactions\/refresh` endpoint. Note that for newly created Items, data may not be immediately available to `\/transactions\/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available. To be alerted when new data is available, listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https:\/\/plaid.com\/docs\/api\/products\/transactions\/#sync_updates_available) webhook."}

OAuth tokens created using the Authorizations API will be unable to access GitHub Enterprise Server SAML organizations. For more information, see the [blog post](https:\/\/developer.github.com\/changes\/2019-11-05-deprecated-passwords-and-authorizations-api).

First, you need ```contract_address``` from [Deploy a contract for NFT products](..\/3.json\/paths\/~1v0~1contracts\/post) and ```metadata_updatable``` must be set ```true```. 2. Secondly, you need ```token_id``` from [Customizable minting](..\/3.json\/paths\/~1v0~1mints~1customizable\/post) or [Batch customizable minting](..\/3.json\/paths\/~1v0~1mints~1customizable~1batch\/post). 3. If you only wish to update the metadata URI set a new ```metadata_uri```. If you wish to update metadata URI and freeze both at the same time then set a new ```metadata_uri``` and ```freeze_metadata``` as ```true```. If you only want to freeze existing metadata URI, then set ```freeze_metadata``` as ```true```. #### Useful for: * Creating dynamic NFTs (NFTs that change after minting based on events). * Revealing NFTs after the drop. #### Related: * If you want to learn how to use [customizable minting](..\/3.json\/paths\/~1v0~1mints~1customizable\/post), see [Customizable Minting Quickstart](docs\/minting\/Minting-Quickstart.md#customizable-minting). * If you wish to list all your previously minted NFTs, see [List all your minted NFTs](..\/3.json\/paths\/~1v0~1me~1mints\/get)."}

{"source_file":"chargify.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: POST | Path: \/subscriptions\/{subscription_id}\/migrations.json | Summary: Migrate Subscription Product | Tags: Subscription Products","target_text":"In order to create a migration, you must pass the `product_id` or `product_handle` in the object when you send a POST request. You may also pass either a `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle` to choose which price point the subscription is moved to. If no price point identifier is passed the subscription will be moved to the products default price point. The response will be the updated subscription. ## Valid Subscriptions Subscriptions should be in the `active` or `trialing` state in order to be migrated. (For backwards compatibility reasons, it is possible to migrate a subscription that is in the `trial_ended` state via the API, however this is not recommended. Since `trial_ended` is an end-of-life state, the subscription should be canceled, the product changed, and then the subscription can be reactivated.) ## Migrations Documentation Full documentation on how to record Migrations in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https:\/\/chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/4407898373531). ## Failed Migrations One of the most common ways that a migration can fail is when the attempt is made to migrate a subscription to it's current product. Please be aware of this issue! ## Migration 3D Secure - Stripe It may happen that a payment needs 3D Secure Authentication when the subscription is migrated to a new product; this is referred to in our help docs as a [post-authentication flow](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5405177432077#psd2-flows-pre-authentication-and-post-authentication). The server returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` in this case with the following response: ```json { \"errors\": [ \"Your card was declined. This transaction requires 3D secure authentication.\" ], \"gateway_payment_id\": \"pi_1F0aGoJ2UDb3Q4av7zU3sHPh\", \"description\": \"This card requires 3D secure authentication. Redirect the customer to the URL from the action_link attribute to authenticate. Attach callback_url param to this URL if you want to be notified about the result of 3D Secure authentication. Attach redirect_url param to this URL if you want to redirect a customer back to your page after 3D Secure authentication. Example: https:\/\/mysite.chargify.com\/3d-secure\/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?one_time_token_id=128&callback_url=https:\/\/localhost:4000&redirect_url=https:\/\/yourpage.com will do a POST request to https:\/\/localhost:4000 after payment is authenticated and will redirect a customer to https:\/\/yourpage.com after 3DS authentication.\", \"action_link\": \"http:\/\/acme.chargify.com\/3d-secure\/pi_1F0aGoJ2UDb3Q4av7zU3sHPh?one_time_token_id=242\" } ``` To let the customer go through 3D Secure Authentication, they need to be redirected to the URL specified in `action_link`. Optionally, you can specify `callback_url` parameter in the `action_link` URL if you’d like to be notified about the result of 3D Secure Authentication. The `callback_url` will return the following information: - whether the authentication was successful (`success`) - the gateway ID for the payment (`gateway_payment_id`) - the subscription ID (`subscription_id`) Lastly, you can also specify a `redirect_url` within the `action_link` URL if you’d like to redirect a customer back to your site. It is not possible to use `action_link` in an iframe inside a custom application. You have to redirect the customer directly to the `action_link`, then, to be notified about the result, use `redirect_url` or `callback_url`. The final URL that you send a customer to to complete 3D Secure may resemble the following, where the first half is the `action_link` and the second half contains a `redirect_url` and `callback_url`: `https:\/\/mysite.chargify.com\/3d-secure\/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?one_time_token_id=128&callback_url=https:\/\/localhost:4000&redirect_url=https:\/\/yourpage.com` ### Example Redirect Flow You may wish to redirect customers to different pages depending on whether their SCA was performed successfully. Here's an example flow to use as a reference: 1. Create a migration via API; it requires 3DS 2. You receive a `gateway_payment_id` in the `action_link` along other params in the response. 3. Use this `gateway_payment_id` to, for example, connect with your internal resources or generate a session_id 4. Include 1 of those attributes inside the `callback_url` and `redirect_url` to be aware which “session” this applies to 5. Redirect the customer to the `action_link` with `callback_url` and `redirect_url` applied 6. After the customer finishes 3DS authentication, we let you know the result by making a request to applied `callback_url`. 7. After that, we redirect the customer to the `redirect_url`; at this point the result of authentication is known 8. Optionally, you can use the applied \"msg\" param in the `redirect_url` to determine whether it was successful or not."}

You can define an event trigger on any of the following objects: * Account * AccountingCode * AccountingPeriod * Amendment * BillingRun * Contact * CreditBalanceAdjustment * CreditMemo * CreditMemoApplication * CreditMemoApplicationItem * CreditMemoItem * DebitMemo * DebitMemoItem * Feature * Invoice * InvoiceAdjustment * InvoiceItem * InvoiceItemAdjustment * JournalEntry * JournalEntryItem * Order * OrderAction * Payment * PaymentApplication * PaymentMethod * PaymentPart * Product * ProductFeature * ProductRatePlan * ProductRatePlanCharge * RatePlan * RatePlanCharge * Refund * RefundApplication * RevenueEvent * RevenueEventItem * RevenueSchedule * RevenueScheduleItem * Subscription * SubscriptionProductFeature * TaxationItem * Usage #### Tenant level base objects and tenant level event triggers Zuora identifies the following base objects as the tenant level base objects: * AccountingCode * AccountingPeriod * BillingRun * Feature * JournalEntry * JournalEntryItem * Product * ProductFeature * ProductRatePlan * ProductRatePlanCharge Event triggers defined on tenant level base objects are tenant level event triggers. Notifications associated with tenant level events are system notifications. **Note:** Tenant level event triggers and system notifications are only available in the default profile. ### Define the trigger condition The `condition` field is a [JEXL](http:\/\/commons.apache.org\/proper\/commons-jexl\/) expression that specifies when to trigger events. The expression can contain fields from the object that the trigger is defined on. **Note:** The condition cannot contain fields from [data source](https:\/\/knowledgecenter.zuora.com\/DC_Developers\/M_Export_ZOQL) objects that are joined to the object that the trigger is defined on. For example, the following condition causes an event to be triggered whenever an invoice is posted with an amount greater than 1000: ```changeType == 'UPDATE' && Invoice.Status == 'Posted' && Invoice.Status_old != 'Posted' && Invoice.Amount > 1000``` Where: * `changeType` is a keyword that specifies the type of change that occurred to the Invoice object. For all objects, the supported values of `changeType` are `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. * `Invoice.Status` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field after the change occurred. * `Invoice.Status_old` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field before the change occurred. In the above example, the value of `baseObject` is `Invoice`. ### Limitations This event trigger has the following limitations: * The maximum number of event triggers is 20. If you want to increase the limit, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https:\/\/support.zuora.com). * The INSERT change type is not supported on RatePlan base objects. * The INSERT change type is not supported on SubscriptionProductFeature base objects."}

If a test clock is advanced, we will simulate the changes that ought to occur during the time that elapsed. For instance, a client creates a weekly recurring transfer with a test clock set at t. When the client advances the test clock by setting `virtual_time` = t + 15 days, 2 new originations should be created, along with the webhook events. The advancement of the test clock from its current `virtual_time` should be limited such that there are no more than 20 originations resulting from the advance operation on each `recurring_transfer` associated with the `test_clock`. For instance, if the recurring transfer associated with this test clock originates once every 4 weeks, you can advance the `virtual_time` up to 80 weeks on each API call."}

For example, if the payment profile you are attempting to update is a credit card, you cannot pass in bank account attributes (like `bank_account_number`), and vice versa. - Updating a payment profile directly will not trigger an attempt to capture a past-due balance. If this is the intent, update the card details via the Subscription instead. - If you are using Authorize.net or Stripe, you may elect to manually trigger a retry for a past due subscription after a partial update."}

{"source_file":"bitbucket.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: GET | Path: \/repositories\/{workspace}\/{repo_slug}\/src\/{commit}\/{path} | Summary: Get file or directory contents | Tags: Source, Repositories","target_text":"This endpoints is used to retrieve the contents of a single file, or the contents of a directory at a specified revision. #### Raw file contents When `path` points to a file, this endpoint returns the raw contents. The response's Content-Type is derived from the filename extension (not from the contents). The file contents are not processed and no character encoding\/recoding is performed and as a result no character encoding is included as part of the Content-Type. The `Content-Disposition` header will be \"attachment\" to prevent browsers from running executable files. If the file is managed by LFS, then a 301 redirect pointing to Atlassian's media services platform is returned. The response includes an ETag that is based on the contents of the file and its attributes. This means that an empty `__init__.py` always returns the same ETag, regardless on the directory it lives in, or the commit it is on. #### File meta data When the request for a file path includes the query parameter `?format=meta`, instead of returning the file's raw contents, Bitbucket instead returns the JSON object describing the file's properties: ```javascript $ curl https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef\/tests\/__init__.py?format=meta { \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/__init__.py\" }, \"meta\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/__init__.py?format=meta\" } }, \"path\": \"tests\/__init__.py\", \"commit\": { \"type\": \"commit\", \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/commit\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\" }, \"html\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/atlassian\/bbql\/commits\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\" } } }, \"attributes\": [], \"type\": \"commit_file\", \"size\": 0 } ``` File objects contain an `attributes` element that contains a list of possible modifiers. Currently defined values are: * `link` -- indicates that the entry is a symbolic link. The contents of the file represent the path the link points to. * `executable` -- indicates that the file has the executable bit set. * `subrepository` -- indicates that the entry points to a submodule or subrepo. The contents of the file is the SHA1 of the repository pointed to. * `binary` -- indicates whether Bitbucket thinks the file is binary. This endpoint can provide an alternative to how a HEAD request can be used to check for the existence of a file, or a file's size without incurring the overhead of receiving its full contents. #### Directory listings When `path` points to a directory instead of a file, the response is a paginated list of directory and file objects in the same order as the underlying SCM system would return them. For example: ```javascript $ curl https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef\/tests { \"pagelen\": 10, \"values\": [ { \"path\": \"tests\/test_project\", \"type\": \"commit_directory\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/test_project\/\" }, \"meta\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/test_project\/?format=meta\" } }, \"commit\": { \"type\": \"commit\", \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/commit\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\" }, \"html\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/atlassian\/bbql\/commits\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\" } } } }, { \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/__init__.py\" }, \"meta\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/__init__.py?format=meta\" } }, \"path\": \"tests\/__init__.py\", \"commit\": { \"type\": \"commit\", \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/commit\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\" }, \"html\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/atlassian\/bbql\/commits\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\" } } }, \"attributes\": [], \"type\": \"commit_file\", \"size\": 0 } ], \"page\": 1, \"size\": 2 } ``` When listing the contents of the repo's root directory, the use of a trailing slash at the end of the URL is required. The response by default is not recursive, meaning that only the direct contents of a path are returned. The response does not recurse down into subdirectories. In order to \"walk\" the entire directory tree, the client can either parse each response and follow the `self` links of each `commit_directory` object, or can specify a `max_depth` to recurse to. The max_depth parameter will do a breadth-first search to return the contents of the subdirectories up to the depth specified. Breadth-first search was chosen as it leads to the least amount of file system operations for git. If the `max_depth` parameter is specified to be too large, the call will time out and return a 555. Each returned object is either a `commit_file`, or a `commit_directory`, both of which contain a `path` element. This path is the absolute path from the root of the repository. Each object also contains a `commit` object which embeds the commit the file is on. Note that this is merely the commit that was used in the URL. It is *not* the commit that last modified the file. Directory objects have 2 representations. Their `self` link returns the paginated contents of the directory. The `meta` link on the other hand returns the actual `directory` object itself, e.g.: ```javascript { \"path\": \"tests\/test_project\", \"type\": \"commit_directory\", \"links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/test_project\/\" }, \"meta\": { \"href\": \"https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src\/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\/tests\/test_project\/?format=meta\" } }, \"commit\": { ... } } ``` #### Querying, filtering and sorting Like most API endpoints, this API supports the Bitbucket querying\/filtering syntax and so you could filter a directory listing to only include entries that match certain criteria. For instance, to list all binary files over 1kb use the expression: `size > 1024 and attributes = \"binary\"` which after urlencoding yields the query string: `?q=size%3E1024+and+attributes%3D%22binary%22` To change the ordering of the response, use the `?sort` parameter: `...\/src\/eefd5ef\/?sort=-size` See [filtering and sorting](\/cloud\/bitbucket\/rest\/intro\/#filtering) for more details."}

{"source_file":"chargify.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: PUT | Path: \/subscriptions\/{subscription_id}\/override.json | Summary: Override Subscription | Tags: Subscriptions","target_text":"This API endpoint allows you to set certain subscription fields that are usually managed for you automatically. Some of the fields can be set via the normal Subscriptions Update API, but others can only be set using this endpoint. This endpoint is provided for cases where you need to “align” Chargify data with data that happened in your system, perhaps before you started using Chargify. For example, you may choose to import your historical subscription data, and would like the activation and cancellation dates in Chargify to match your existing historical dates. Chargify does not backfill historical events (i.e. from the Events API), but some static data can be changed via this API. Why are some fields only settable from this endpoint, and not the normal subscription create and update endpoints? Because we want users of this endpoint to be aware that these fields are usually managed by Chargify, and using this API means **you are stepping out on your own.** Changing these fields will not affect any other attributes. For example, adding an expiration date will not affect the next assessment date on the subscription. If you regularly need to override the current_period_starts_at for new subscriptions, this can also be accomplished by setting both `previous_billing_at` and `next_billing_at` at subscription creation. See the documentation on [Importing Subscriptions](.\/b3A6MTQxMDgzODg-create-subscription#subscriptions-import) for more information. ## Limitations When passing `current_period_starts_at` some validations are made: 1. The subscription needs to be unbilled (no statements or invoices). 2. The value passed must be a valid date\/time. We recommend using the iso 8601 format. 3. The value passed must be before the current date\/time. If unpermitted parameters are sent, a 400 HTTP response is sent along with a string giving the reason for the problem."}

{"source_file":"asana.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: POST | Path: \/webhooks | Summary: Establish a webhook | Tags: Webhooks","target_text":"Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST request initiates the creation similar to creating any other resource. Next, in the middle of this request comes the confirmation handshake. When a webhook is created, we will send a test POST to the target with an `X-Hook-Secret` header. The target must respond with a `200 OK` or `204 No Content` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm that this webhook subscription is indeed expected. We strongly recommend storing this secret to be used to verify future webhook event signatures. The POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status of the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation handshake it will fail to setup, and you will receive an error in response to your attempt to create it. This means you need to be able to receive and complete the webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight (in other words, have a server that can handle requests asynchronously).

Installation tokens expire one hour from the time you create them. Using an expired token produces a status code of `401 - Unauthorized`, and requires creating a new installation token. By default the installation token has access to all repositories that the installation can access. Optionally, you can use the `repositories` or `repository_ids` body parameters to specify individual repositories that the installation access token can access. If you don't use `repositories` or `repository_ids` to grant access to specific repositories, the installation access token will have access to all repositories that the installation was granted access to. The installation access token cannot be granted access to repositories that the installation was not granted access to. Up to 500 repositories can be listed in this manner. Optionally, use the `permissions` body parameter to specify the permissions that the installation access token should have. If `permissions` is not specified, the installation access token will have all of the permissions that were granted to the app. The installation access token cannot be granted permissions that the app was not granted. When using the repository or permission parameters to reduce the access of the token, the complexity of the token is increased due to both the number of permissions in the request and the number of repositories the token will have access to. If the complexity is too large, the token will fail to be issued. If this occurs, the error message will indicate the maximum number of repositories that should be requested. For the average application requesting 8 permissions, this limit is around 5000 repositories. With fewer permissions requested, more repositories are supported.

Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the `\/accounts\/get` endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the `\/asset_report\/filter` endpoint.

{"source_file":"github.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: GET | Path: \/repos\/{owner}\/{repo}\/contents\/{path} | Summary: Get repository content | Tags: repos","target_text":"Gets the contents of a file or directory in a repository. Specify the file path or directory with the `path` parameter. If you omit the `path` parameter, you will receive the contents of the repository's root directory. This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see \"[Media types](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/using-the-rest-api\/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types).\" - **`application\/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file contents for files and symlinks. - **`application\/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file contents in HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source [Markup library](https:\/\/github.com\/github\/markup). - **`application\/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example, instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects. If the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their \"type\" specified as \"file\". Logically, the value _should_ be \"submodule\". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility purposes](https:\/\/git.io\/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as \"submodule\". If the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink itself. If the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links[\"git\"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links[\"html\"]`) will have null values. **Notes**: - To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/git\/trees#get-a-tree). - This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve more files, use the [Git Trees API](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/git\/trees#get-a-tree). - Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download. - If the requested file's size is: - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported. - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty string and the `encoding` field will be `\"none\"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type. - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported."}

It is focused on how allocations operate within the Chargify UI.It goes into greater detail on how the user interface will react when recording allocations. This documentation also goes into greater detail on how proration is taken into consideration when applying component allocations. ## Proration Schemes Changing the allocated quantity of a component mid-period can result in either a Charge or Credit being applied to the subscription. When creating an allocation via the API, you can pass the `upgrade_charge`, `downgrade_credit`, and `accrue_charge` to be applied. **Notice:** These proration and accural fields will be ignored for Prepaid Components since this component type always generate charges immediately without proration. For background information on prorated components and upgrade\/downgrade schemes, see [Setting Component Allocations.](https:\/\/maxio-chargify.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5404527849997#proration-upgrades-vs-downgrades). See the tables below for valid values. | upgrade_charge | Definition | |----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------| | `full` | A charge is added for the full price of the component. | | `prorated` | A charge is added for the prorated price of the component change. | | `none` | No charge is added. | | downgrade_credit | Definition | |------------------|---------------------------------------------------| | `full` | A full price credit is added for the amount owed. | | `prorated` | A prorated credit is added for the amount owed. | | `none` | No charge is added. | | accrue_charge | Definition | |---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | `true` | Attempt to charge the customer at next renewal. | | `false` | Attempt to charge the customer right away.

For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https:\/\/plaid.com\/docs\/api\/products\/investments\/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available. Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift. Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `\/transactions\/get`. For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https:\/\/plaid.com\/docs\/transactions\/transactions-data\/#pending-and-posted-transactions). Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions. Data returned by `\/transactions\/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `\/transactions\/refresh` endpoint. Note that data may not be immediately available to `\/transactions\/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `\/transactions\/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https:\/\/plaid.com\/docs\/api\/products\/transactions\/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https:\/\/plaid.com\/docs\/api\/products\/transactions\/#historical_update) webhooks.

To delete or deauthorize a node addon, issue a **PUT** with all fields set to `null` or `False`, or a **PATCH** with enabled set `False`. #### Permissions NodeSettings that are attached to public nodes will give read-only access to everyone. Private nodes require explicit read permission. Write and admin access are the same for public and private nodes. Administrators on a parent node have implicit read permissions for all child nodes. Any users with write or admin access to the node are able to deauthorize an enabled addon, but only the addon authorizer is able to change the configuration (i.e. selected folder) of an already-configured NodeSettings entity. #### Returns Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated node addon, if the request is successful. If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag\/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed."}

There are a couple of different options to initiate a pipeline, where the payload of the request will determine which type of pipeline will be instantiated. # Trigger a Pipeline for a branch One way to trigger pipelines is by specifying the branch for which you want to trigger a pipeline. The specified branch will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will then do a clone of the repository and checkout the latest revision of the specified branch. ### Example ``` $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\ -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\ https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/jeroendr\/meat-demo2\/pipelines\/ \\ -d ' { \"target\": { \"ref_type\": \"branch\", \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\", \"ref_name\": \"master\" } }' ``` # Trigger a Pipeline for a commit on a branch or tag You can initiate a pipeline for a specific commit and in the context of a specified reference (e.g. a branch, tag or bookmark). The specified reference will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will clone the repository and then do a checkout the specified reference. The following reference types are supported: * `branch` * `named_branch` * `bookmark` * `tag` ### Example ``` $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\ -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\ https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/jeroendr\/meat-demo2\/pipelines\/ \\ -d ' { \"target\": { \"commit\": { \"type\": \"commit\", \"hash\": \"ce5b7431602f7cbba007062eeb55225c6e18e956\" }, \"ref_type\": \"branch\", \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\", \"ref_name\": \"master\" } }' ``` # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit. In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition. The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository and checkout the specified revision. ### Example ``` $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\ -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\ https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/jeroendr\/meat-demo2\/pipelines\/ \\ -d ' { \"target\": { \"commit\": { \"hash\":\"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923\", \"type\":\"commit\" }, \"selector\": { \"type\":\"custom\", \"pattern\":\"Deploy to production\" }, \"type\":\"pipeline_commit_target\" } }' ``` # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit on a branch or tag You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit in the context of a specified reference. In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition, as well as the reference information. The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository a checkout the specified reference. ### Example ``` $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\ -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\ https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/jeroendr\/meat-demo2\/pipelines\/ \\ -d ' { \"target\": { \"commit\": { \"hash\":\"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923\", \"type\":\"commit\" }, \"selector\": { \"type\": \"custom\", \"pattern\": \"Deploy to production\" }, \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\", \"ref_name\": \"master\", \"ref_type\": \"branch\" } }' ``` # Trigger a custom pipeline with variables In addition to triggering a custom pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file as shown in the examples above, you can specify variables that will be available for your build. In the request, provide a list of variables, specifying the following for each variable: key, value, and whether it should be secured or not (this field is optional and defaults to not secured). ### Example ``` $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\ -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\ https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/{workspace}\/{repo_slug}\/pipelines\/ \\ -d ' { \"target\": { \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\", \"ref_type\": \"branch\", \"ref_name\": \"master\", \"selector\": { \"type\": \"custom\", \"pattern\": \"Deploy to production\" } }, \"variables\": [ { \"key\": \"var1key\", \"value\": \"var1value\", \"secured\": true }, { \"key\": \"var2key\", \"value\": \"var2value\" } ] }' ``` # Trigger a pull request pipeline You can also initiate a pipeline for a specific pull request. ### Example ``` $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\ -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\ https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/{workspace}\/{repo_slug}\/pipelines\/ \\ -d ' { \"target\": { \"type\": \"pipeline_pullrequest_target\", \"source\": \"pull-request-branch\", \"destination\": \"master\", \"destination_commit\": { \"hash\" : \"9f848b7\" }, \"commit\": { \"hash\" : \"1a372fc\" }, \"pullrequest\" : { \"id\" : \"3\" }, \"selector\": { \"type\": \"pull-requests\", \"pattern\": \"**\" } } }' ```"}

Use this to add and delete files and to change a snippet's title. To update a snippet, one can either PUT a full snapshot, or only the parts that need to be changed. The contract for PUT on this API is that properties missing from the request remain untouched so that snippets can be efficiently manipulated with differential payloads. To delete a property (e.g. the title, or a file), include its name in the request, but omit its value (use `null`). As in Git, explicit renaming of files is not supported. Instead, to rename a file, delete it and add it again under another name. This can be done atomically in a single request. Rename detection is left to the SCM. PUT supports three different content types for both request and response bodies: * `application\/json` * `multipart\/related` * `multipart\/form-data` The content type used for the request body can be different than that used for the response. Content types are specified using standard HTTP headers. Use the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to select the desired request and response format. application\/json ---------------- As with creation and retrieval, the content type determines what properties can be manipulated. `application\/json` does not support file contents and is therefore limited to a snippet's meta data. To update the title, without changing any of its files: $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application\/json\" https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst\/kypj -d '{\"title\": \"Updated title\"}' To delete the title: $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application\/json\" https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst\/kypj -d '{\"title\": null}' Not all parts of a snippet can be manipulated. The owner and creator for instance are immutable. multipart\/related ----------------- `multipart\/related` can be used to manipulate all of a snippet's properties. The body is identical to a POST. properties omitted from the request are left unchanged. Since the `start` part contains JSON, the mechanism for manipulating the snippet's meta data is identical to `application\/json` requests. To update one of a snippet's file contents, while also changing its title: PUT \/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst\/kypj HTTP\/1.1 Content-Length: 288 Content-Type: multipart\/related; start=\"snippet\"; boundary=\"===============1438169132528273974==\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: application\/json; charset=\"utf-8\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-ID: snippet { \"title\": \"My updated snippet\", \"files\": { \"foo.txt\": {} } } --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: text\/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-ID: \"foo.txt\" Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"foo.txt\" Updated file contents. --===============1438169132528273974==-- Here only the parts that are changed are included in the body.

If a filename in the `files` list does not have a corresponding part, it will be deleted from the snippet, as shown below: PUT \/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst\/kypj HTTP\/1.1 Content-Length: 188 Content-Type: multipart\/related; start=\"snippet\"; boundary=\"===============1438169132528273974==\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: application\/json; charset=\"utf-8\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-ID: snippet { \"files\": { \"image.png\": {} } } --===============1438169132528273974==-- To simulate a rename, delete a file and add the same file under another name: PUT \/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst\/kypj HTTP\/1.1 Content-Length: 212 Content-Type: multipart\/related; start=\"snippet\"; boundary=\"===============1438169132528273974==\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: application\/json; charset=\"utf-8\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-ID: snippet { \"files\": { \"foo.txt\": {}, \"bar.txt\": {} } } --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: text\/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-ID: \"bar.txt\" Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"bar.txt\" foo --===============1438169132528273974==-- multipart\/form-data ----------------- Again, one can also use `multipart\/form-data` to manipulate file contents and meta data atomically. $ curl -X PUT http:\/\/localhost:12345\/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst\/kypj -F title=\"My updated snippet\" -F file=@foo.txt PUT \/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst\/kypj HTTP\/1.1 Content-Length: 351 Content-Type: multipart\/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f ------------------------------63a4b224c59f Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"foo.txt\" Content-Type: text\/plain foo ------------------------------63a4b224c59f Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"title\" My updated snippet ------------------------------63a4b224c59f To delete a file, omit its contents while including its name in the `files` field: $ curl -X PUT https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst\/kypj -F files=image.png PUT \/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst\/kypj HTTP\/1.1 Content-Length: 149 Content-Type: multipart\/form-data; boundary=----------------------------ef8871065a86 ------------------------------ef8871065a86 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"files\" image.png ------------------------------ef8871065a86-- The explicit use of the `files` element in `multipart\/related` and `multipart\/form-data` is only required when deleting files.

The [OAuth Authorizations API](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/oauth-authorizations\/oauth-authorizations) will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https:\/\/developer.github.com\/changes\/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint\/). **Warning:** Apps must use the [web application flow](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/apps\/building-oauth-apps\/authorizing-oauth-apps\/#web-application-flow) to obtain OAuth tokens that work with GitHub Enterprise Server SAML organizations. OAuth tokens created using the Authorizations API will be unable to access GitHub Enterprise Server SAML organizations. For more information, see the [blog post](https:\/\/developer.github.com\/changes\/2019-11-05-deprecated-passwords-and-authorizations-api). Creates OAuth tokens using [Basic Authentication](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/overview\/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication). If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens. For more information, see \"[Working with two-factor authentication](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/overview\/other-authentication-methods#working-with-two-factor-authentication).\" To create tokens for a particular OAuth application using this endpoint, you must authenticate as the user you want to create an authorization for and provide the app's client ID and secret, found on your OAuth application's settings page. If your OAuth application intends to create multiple tokens for one user, use `fingerprint` to differentiate between them. You can also create tokens on GitHub Enterprise Server from the [personal access tokens settings](https:\/\/github.com\/settings\/tokens) page. Read more about these tokens in [the GitHub Help documentation](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/articles\/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use). Organizations that enforce SAML SSO require personal access tokens to be allowed.

The subscription’s billing period will also remain the same. - If set to `false` and something goes wrong i.e. payment fails, then Chargify will continue through with the activation and enter an end of life state. For trialing subscriptions, that will either be trial ended (if the trial is no obligation), past due (if the trial has an obligation), or canceled (if the site has no dunning strategy, or has a strategy that says to cancel immediately). For awaiting signup subscriptions, that will always be canceled.

The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub Enterprise Server we often deploy branches and verify them before we merge a pull request. The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`. The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds, the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will return a failure response. By default, [commit statuses](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/enterprise-server@3.9\/rest\/commits\/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success` state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed. The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched. The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an application with debugging enabled. Merged branch response: You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating a deployment. This auto-merge happens when: * Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository * Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example * There are no merge conflicts If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful response. Merge conflict response: This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts. Failed commit status checks: This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success` status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`. OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` or `repo_deployment` scope to use this endpoint."}

If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer, GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network and for non-Eurozone markets typically via the local payment scheme, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer or other local payment schemes will typically arrive in one business day. Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.

Registrations can be made public immediately or embargoed for up to 4 years. #### Withdrawals Registrations cannot be deleted, but they can be withdrawn. Withdrawing a registration removes the content of the registration but leaves behind basic metadata. A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information, namely, title, description, date_created, date_registered, date_withdrawn, registration, withdrawn, withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only relationship that remains accesible for a withdrawn registration is the contributors. All other relationships will return a **403 Forbidden** response. #### Returns Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys. The `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration, meaning additional requests to a registration's detail view are not necessary. The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag\/Pagination). This request should never return an error. #### Filtering You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/registrations\/?filter[title]=open. Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`."}

A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`. #### Holder object #### The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is `\"type\": \"group\"`, and the parameter is the group name, `\"parameter\": \"Teams in space administrators\"` and the value is group ID, `\"value\": \"ca85fac0-d974-40ca-a615-7af99c48d24f\"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties: * `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below). * `parameter` As a group's name can change, use of `value` is recommended. The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name. * `value` The value of this property depends on the `type`. If the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group ID. For other `type` it has the same value as `parameter` The following `types` are available. The expected values for `parameter` and `value` are given in parentheses (some types may not have a `parameter` or `value`): * `anyone` Grant for anonymous users. * `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name, application name). See [Update product access settings](https:\/\/confluence.atlassian.com\/x\/3YxjL) for more information. * `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue. * `group` Grant for the specified group (`parameter` : group name, `value` : group ID). * `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID). * `projectLead` Grant for a project lead. * `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (`parameter` :project role ID, `value` : project role ID). * `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue. * `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https:\/\/confluence.atlassian.com\/x\/24dKLg) for more information. * `user` Grant for the specified user (`parameter` : user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used, `value` : user ID). * `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID). #### Built-in permissions #### The [built-in Jira permissions](https:\/\/confluence.atlassian.com\/x\/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https:\/\/developer.atlassian.com\/cloud\/jira\/platform\/modules\/project-permission\/) and [global permission](https:\/\/developer.atlassian.com\/cloud\/jira\/platform\/modules\/global-permission\/) module documentation for more information. **Project permissions** * `ADMINISTER_PROJECTS` * `BROWSE_PROJECTS` * `MANAGE_SPRINTS_PERMISSION` (Jira Software only) * `SERVICEDESK_AGENT` (Jira Service Desk only) * `VIEW_DEV_TOOLS` (Jira Software only) * `VIEW_READONLY_WORKFLOW` **Issue permissions** * `ASSIGNABLE_USER` * `ASSIGN_ISSUES` * `CLOSE_ISSUES` * `CREATE_ISSUES` * `DELETE_ISSUES` * `EDIT_ISSUES` * `LINK_ISSUES` * `MODIFY_REPORTER` * `MOVE_ISSUES` * `RESOLVE_ISSUES` * `SCHEDULE_ISSUES` * `SET_ISSUE_SECURITY` * `TRANSITION_ISSUES` **Voters and watchers permissions** * `MANAGE_WATCHERS` * `VIEW_VOTERS_AND_WATCHERS` **Comments permissions** * `ADD_COMMENTS` * `DELETE_ALL_COMMENTS` * `DELETE_OWN_COMMENTS` * `EDIT_ALL_COMMENTS` * `EDIT_OWN_COMMENTS` **Attachments permissions** * `CREATE_ATTACHMENTS` * `DELETE_ALL_ATTACHMENTS` * `DELETE_OWN_ATTACHMENTS` **Time tracking permissions** * `DELETE_ALL_WORKLOGS` * `DELETE_OWN_WORKLOGS` * `EDIT_ALL_WORKLOGS` * `EDIT_OWN_WORKLOGS` * `WORK_ON_ISSUES` **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira."}

You can still keep the existing Subscribe and Amend API integrations to create and manage subscriptions. **Note:** The [Order Line Items](https:\/\/knowledgecenter.zuora.com\/Billing\/Subscriptions\/Orders\/Order_Line_Items\/AA_Overview_of_Order_Line_Items) feature is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. If you want to join this early adopter program, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https:\/\/support.zuora.com\/). Retrieves the detailed information about all orders for a specified subscription. Any orders containing the changes on the specified subscription are returned."}

Passing `group` parameters with a `target` containing a `type` and optional `id` is all that's needed. When the `target` parameter specifies a `\"customer\"` or `\"subscription\"` that is already part of a hierarchy, the subscription will become a member of the customer's subscription group. If the target customer or subscription is not part of a subscription group, a new group will be created and the subscription will become part of the group with the specified target customer set as the responsible payer for the group's subscriptions. **Please Note:** In order to add an existing subscription to a subscription group, it must belong to either the same customer record as the target, or be within the same customer hierarchy. Rather than specifying a customer, the `target` parameter could instead simply have a value of * `\"self\"` which indicates the subscription will be paid for not by some other customer, but by the subscribing customer, * `\"parent\"` which indicates the subscription will be paid for by the subscribing customer's parent within a customer hierarchy, or * `\"eldest\"` which indicates the subscription will be paid for by the root-level customer in the subscribing customer's hierarchy. To create a new subscription into a subscription group, please reference the following: [Create Subscription in a Subscription Group](https:\/\/developers.chargify.com\/docs\/api-docs\/d571659cf0f24-create-subscription#subscription-in-a-subscription-group)"}

A user is premium if any of the following is true: - The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium workspace - The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace Even if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium workspace, search will allow them to find data anywhere in the workspace, not just inside the premium team. Making a search request using credentials of a non-premium user will result in a `402 Payment Required` error. #### Pagination Search results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times may return the data in a different order, even if the data do not change. Because of this, the traditional [pagination](https:\/\/developers.asana.com\/docs\/#pagination) available elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here. However, you can paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time and then modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have already seen. Page sizes are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can be specified by the `limit` query parameter. #### Eventual consistency Changes in Asana (regardless of whether they’re made though the web product or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be indexed. This process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete under normal operation, and longer during some production incidents. Making a change to a task that would alter its presence in a particular search query will not be reflected immediately. This is also true of the advanced search feature in the web product. #### Rate limits You may receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response if you hit any of our [rate limits](https:\/\/developers.asana.com\/docs\/#rate-limits). #### Custom field parameters | Parameter name | Custom field type | Accepted type | |---|---|---| | custom_fields.{gid}.is_set | All | Boolean | | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Text | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Number | Number | | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Enum | Enum option ID | | custom_fields.{gid}.starts_with | Text only | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.ends_with | Text only | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.contains | Text only | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.less_than | Number only | Number | | custom_fields.{gid}.greater_than | Number only | Number | For example, if the gid of the custom field is 12345, these query parameter to find tasks where it is set would be `custom_fields.12345.is_set=true`. To match an exact value for an enum custom field, use the gid of the desired enum option and not the name of the enum option: `custom_fields.12345.value=67890`. **Not Supported**: searching for multiple exact matches of a custom field, searching for multi-enum custom field *Note: If you specify `projects.any` and `sections.any`, you will receive tasks for the project **and** tasks for the section.

{"source_file":"bitbucket.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: POST | Path: \/repositories\/{workspace}\/{repo_slug}\/src | Summary: Create a commit by uploading a file | Tags: Source, Repositories","target_text":"This endpoint is used to create new commits in the repository by uploading files. To add a new file to a repository: ``` $ curl https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/username\/slug\/src \\ -F \/repo\/path\/to\/image.png=@image.png ``` This will create a new commit on top of the main branch, inheriting the contents of the main branch, but adding (or overwriting) the `image.png` file to the repository in the `\/repo\/path\/to` directory. To create a commit that deletes files, use the `files` parameter: ``` $ curl https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/username\/slug\/src \\ -F files=\/file\/to\/delete\/1.txt \\ -F files=\/file\/to\/delete\/2.txt ``` You can add\/modify\/delete multiple files in a request. Rename\/move a file by deleting the old path and adding the content at the new path. This endpoint accepts `multipart\/form-data` (as in the examples above), as well as `application\/x-www-form-urlencoded`. #### multipart\/form-data A `multipart\/form-data` post contains a series of \"form fields\" that identify both the individual files that are being uploaded, as well as additional, optional meta data. Files are uploaded in file form fields (those that have a `Content-Disposition` parameter) whose field names point to the remote path in the repository where the file should be stored. Path field names are always interpreted to be absolute from the root of the repository, regardless whether the client uses a leading slash (as the above `curl` example did). File contents are treated as bytes and are not decoded as text. The commit message, as well as other non-file meta data for the request, is sent along as normal form field elements. Meta data fields share the same namespace as the file objects. For `multipart\/form-data` bodies that should not lead to any ambiguity, as the `Content-Disposition` header will contain the `filename` parameter to distinguish between a file named \"message\" and the commit message field. #### application\/x-www-form-urlencoded It is also possible to upload new files using a simple `application\/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST. This can be convenient when uploading pure text files: ``` $ curl https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/repositories\/atlassian\/bbql\/src \\ --data-urlencode \"\/path\/to\/me.txt=Lorem ipsum.\" \\ --data-urlencode \"message=Initial commit\" \\ --data-urlencode \"author=Erik van Zijst \" ``` There could be a field name clash if a client were to upload a file named \"message\", as this filename clashes with the meta data property for the commit message. To avoid this and to upload files whose names clash with the meta data properties, use a leading slash for the files, e.g. `curl --data-urlencode \"\/message=file contents\"`. When an explicit slash is omitted for a file whose path matches that of a meta data parameter, then it is interpreted as meta data, not as a file. #### Executables and links While this API aims to facilitate the most common use cases, it is possible to perform some more advanced operations like creating a new symlink in the repository, or creating an executable file. Files can be supplied with a `x-attributes` value in the `Content-Disposition` header. For example, to upload an executable file, as well as create a symlink from `README.txt` to `README`: ``` --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: text\/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-ID: \"bin\/shutdown.sh\" Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"shutdown.sh\"; x-attributes:\"executable\" #!\/bin\/sh halt --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: text\/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-ID: \"\/README.txt\" Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"README.txt\"; x-attributes:\"link\" README --===============1438169132528273974==-- ``` Links are files that contain the target path and have `x-attributes:\"link\"` set. When overwriting links with files, or vice versa, the newly uploaded file determines both the new contents, as well as the attributes. That means uploading a file without specifying `x-attributes=\"link\"` will create a regular file, even if the parent commit hosted a symlink at the same path. The same applies to executables. When modifying an existing executable file, the form-data file element must include `x-attributes=\"executable\"` in order to preserve the executable status of the file. Note that this API does not support the creation or manipulation of subrepos \/ submodules."}

{"source_file":"github.yaml","type":"operation_description","input_text":"Method: DELETE | Path: \/repos\/{owner}\/{repo}\/code-scanning\/analyses\/{analysis_id} | Summary: Delete a code scanning analysis from a repository | Tags: code-scanning","target_text":"Deletes a specified code scanning analysis from a repository. You can delete one analysis at a time. To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards. Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor. When you list the analyses for a repository, one or more will be identified as deletable in the response: ``` \"deletable\": true ``` An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses. Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses for each enabled code scanning tool, where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values: * `ref` * `tool` * `category` If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set, you'll get a 400 response with the message: ``` Analysis specified is not deletable. ``` The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set: `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`. Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis for the specified tool in your repository. Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool. When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url` in the 200 response is `null`. As an example of the deletion process, let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses: 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch. You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool. You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool. To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests. To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable. Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable. Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets, delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted. Then repeat the process for the second set. The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop: **Outer loop**: * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool. * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found: **Inner loop**: * Delete the identified analysis. * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration. The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely. OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint with private or public repositories, or the `public_repo` scope to use this endpoint with only public repositories."}

See [Known Limitations in Orders](https:\/\/knowledgecenter.zuora.com\/BC_Subscription_Management\/Orders\/C_Known_Limitations_in_Orders) for additional limitations. The limit of orders allowed on a subscription is 1000. The limit of order line items allowed in an order is 100. Zuora has the following limits on the Orders synchronous API to prevent performance degradation: * Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call. * Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call. If you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends you use the following asynchronous API operations: * [Create an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) * [Preview an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) Zuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to prevent performance degradation: * Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. * Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https:\/\/www.zuora.com\/developer\/api-reference\/#operation\/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call. If you have a need for a large order that exceeds any limits of the above, you can request a limit increase for the Orders asynchronous API by submitting a request at [Zuora Global Support](https:\/\/support.zuora.com). **Note:** When you are to suspend a subcription (via the `suspend` order action), if in the same \"Create an order\" call you are to perform other subsequent order actions on the supscription to suspend, you must first resume the subscription (via a `resume` order action). **Note:** When using this operation to create an account, create a subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if any error occurs during the call, such as a payment processing failure and a tax engine failure, then all the other steps will be rolled back. This means that the invoice will not be generated, the subscription will not be created, and the account will not be created."}

Upon reactivation, any canceled invoices created after the beginning of the primary subscription's billing period will be reopened and payment will be attempted on them. If the subscription group is being reactivated (as opposed to resumed), new charges will also be assessed for the new billing period. Whether a subscription group is reactivated (a new billing period is created) or resumed (the current billing period is respected) will depend on the parameters that are sent with the request as well as the date of the request relative to the primary subscription's period. ## Reactivating within the current period If a subscription group is cancelled and reactivated within the primary subscription's current period, we can choose to either start a new billing period or maintain the existing one. If we want to maintain the existing billing period the `resume=true` option must be passed in request parameters. An exception to the above are subscriptions that are on calendar billing. These subscriptions cannot be reactivated within the current period. If the `resume=true` option is not passed the request will return an error. The `resume_members` option is ignored in this case. All eligible group members will be automatically resumed. ## Reactivating beyond the current period In this case, a subscription group can only be reactivated with a new billing period. If the `resume=true` option is passed it will be ignored. Member subscriptions can have billing periods that are longer than the primary (e.g. a monthly primary with annual group members). If the primary subscription in a group cannot be reactivated within the current period, but other group members can be, passing `resume_members=true` will resume the existing billing period for eligible group members. The primary subscription will begin a new billing period. For calendar billing subscriptions, the new billing period created will be a partial one, spanning from the date of reactivation to the next corresponding calendar renewal date."}

POST \/2.0\/snippets\/evzijst HTTP\/1.1 Content-Length: 1188 Content-Type: multipart\/related; start=\"snippet\"; boundary=\"===============1438169132528273974==\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: application\/json; charset=\"utf-8\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-ID: snippet { \"title\": \"My snippet\", \"is_private\": true, \"scm\": \"git\", \"files\": { \"foo.txt\": {}, \"image.png\": {} } } --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: text\/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-ID: \"foo.txt\" Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"foo.txt\" foo --===============1438169132528273974== Content-Type: image\/png MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 Content-ID: \"image.png\" Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"image.png\" iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAoCAYAAAD+MdrbAAABD0lEQVR4Ae3VMUoDQRTG8ccUaW2m TKONFxArJYJamCvkCnZTaa+VnQdJSBFl2SMsLFrEWNjZBZs0JgiL\/+KrhhVmJRbCLPx4O+\/DT2TB cbblJxf+UWFVVRNsEGAtgvJxnLm2H+A5RQ93uIl+3632PZyl\/skjfOn9Gvdwmlcw5aPUwimG+NT5 EnNN036IaZePUuIcK533NVfal7\/5yjWeot2z9ta1cAczHEf7I+3J0ws9Cgx0fsOFpmlfwKcWPuBQ 73Oc4FHzBaZ8llq4q1mr5B2mOUCt815qYR8eB1hG2VJ7j35q4RofaH7IG+Xrf\/PfJhfmwtfFYoIN AqxFUD6OMxcvkO+UfKfkOyXfKdsv\/AYCHMLVkHAFWgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg== --===============1438169132528273974==-- The request contains multiple parts and is structured as follows. The first part is the JSON document that describes the snippet's properties or meta data. It either has to be the first part, or the request's `Content-Type` header must contain the `start` parameter to point to it. The remaining parts are the files of which there can be zero or more. Each file part should contain the `Content-ID` MIME header through which the JSON meta data's `files` element addresses it. The value should be the name of the file. `Content-Disposition` is an optional MIME header. The header's optional `filename` parameter can be used to specify the file name that Bitbucket should use when writing the file to disk. When present, `filename` takes precedence over the value of `Content-ID`. When the JSON body omits the `files` element, the remaining parts are not ignored. Instead, each file is added to the new snippet as if its name was explicitly linked (the use of the `files` elements is mandatory for some operations like deleting or renaming files). multipart\/form-data ------------------- The use of JSON for the snippet's meta data is optional. Meta data can also be supplied as regular form fields in a more conventional `multipart\/form-data` request: $ curl -X POST -u credentials https:\/\/api.bitbucket.org\/2.0\/snippets -F title=\"My snippet\" -F file=@foo.txt -F file=@image.png POST \/2.0\/snippets HTTP\/1.1 Content-Length: 951 Content-Type: multipart\/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f ------------------------------63a4b224c59f Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"foo.txt\" Content-Type: text\/plain foo ------------------------------63a4b224c59f Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"image.png\" Content-Type: application\/octet-stream ?PNG IHDR?1??I..... ------------------------------63a4b224c59f Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"title\" My snippet ------------------------------63a4b224c59f-- Here the meta data properties are included as flat, top-level form fields. The file attachments use the `file` field name. To attach multiple files, simply repeat the field. The advantage of `multipart\/form-data` over `multipart\/related` is that it can be easier to build clients. Essentially all properties are optional, `title` and `files` included. Sharing and Visibility ---------------------- Snippets can be either public (visible to anyone on Bitbucket, as well as anonymous users), or private (visible only to members of the workspace). This is controlled through the snippet's `is_private` element: * **is_private=false** -- everyone, including anonymous users can view the snippet * **is_private=true** -- only workspace members can view the snippet To create the snippet under a workspace, just append the workspace ID to the URL. See [`\/2.0\/snippets\/{workspace}`](\/cloud\/bitbucket\/rest\/api-group-snippets\/#api-snippets-workspace-post)."}

This occurs when an on-hold subscription is \"resumed\". This returns the subscription to an active state.** + The response returns the subscription object in the `active` or `trialing` state. + The `canceled_at` and `cancellation_message` fields do not have values. + The method works for \"Canceled\" or \"Trial Ended\" subscriptions. + It will not work for items not marked as \"Canceled\", \"Unpaid\", or \"Trial Ended\". ## Resume the current billing period for a subscription A subscription is considered \"resumable\" if you are attempting to reactivate within the billing period the subscription was canceled in. A resumed subscription's billing date remains the same as before it was canceled. In other words, it does not start a new billing period. Payment may or may not be collected for a resumed subscription, depending on whether or not the subscription had a balance when it was canceled (for example, if it was canceled because of dunning). Consider a subscription which was created on June 1st, and would renew on July 1st. The subscription is then canceled on June 15. If a reactivation with `resume: true` were attempted _before_ what would have been the next billing date of July 1st, then Chargify would resume the subscription. If a reactivation with `resume: true` were attempted _after_ what would have been the next billing date of July 1st, then Chargify would not resume the subscription, and instead it would be reactivated with a new billing period. | Canceled | Reactivation | Resumable? | |---|---|---| | Jun 15 | June 28 | Yes | | Jun 15 | July 2 | No | ## Reactivation Scenarios ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription While Preserving Balance + Given you have a product that costs $20 + Given you have a canceled subscription to the $20 product + 1 charge should exist for $20 + 1 payment should exist for $20 + When the subscription has canceled due to dunning, it retained a negative balance of $20 #### Results The resulting charges upon reactivation will be: + 1 charge for $20 for the new product + 1 charge for $20 for the balance due + Total charges = $40 + The subscription will transition to active + The subscription balance will be zero ### Reactivating a Canceled Subscription With Coupon + Given you have a canceled subscription + It has no current period defined + You have a coupon code \"EARLYBIRD\" + The coupon is set to recur for 6 periods PUT request sent to: `https:\/\/acme.chargify.com\/subscriptions\/{subscription_id}\/reactivate.json?coupon_code=EARLYBIRD` #### Results + The subscription will transition to active + The subscription should have applied a coupon with code \"EARLYBIRD\" ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With a Trial, Without the include_trial Flag + Given you have a canceled subscription + The product associated with the subscription has a trial + PUT request to `https:\/\/acme.chargify.com\/subscriptions\/{subscription_id}\/reactivate.json` #### Results + The subscription will transition to active ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With Trial, With the include_trial Flag + Given you have a canceled subscription + The product associated with the subscription has a trial + Send a PUT request to `https:\/\/acme.chargify.com\/subscriptions\/{subscription_id}\/reactivate.json?include_trial=1` #### Results + The subscription will transition to trialing ### Reactivating Trial Ended Subscription + Given you have a trial_ended subscription + Send a PUT request to `https:\/\/acme.chargify.com\/subscriptions\/{subscription_id}\/reactivate.json` #### Results + The subscription will transition to active ### Resuming a Canceled Subscription + Given you have a `canceled` subscription and it is resumable + Send a PUT request to `https:\/\/acme.chargify.com\/subscriptions\/{subscription_id}\/reactivate.json?resume=true` #### Results + The subscription will transition to active + The next billing date should not have changed ### Attempting to resume a subscription which is not resumable + Given you have a `canceled` subscription, and it is not resumable + Send a PUT request to `https:\/\/acme.chargify.com\/subscriptions\/{subscription_id}\/reactivate.json?resume=true` #### Results + The subscription will transition to active, with a new billing period. ### Attempting to resume but not reactivate a subscription which is not resumable + Given you have a `canceled` subscription, and it is not resumable + Send a PUT request to `https:\/\/acme.chargify.com\/subscriptions\/{subscription_id}\/reactivate.json?resume[require_resume]=true` + The response status should be \"422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY\" + The subscription should be canceled with the following response ``` { \"errors\": [\"Request was 'resume only', but this subscription cannot be resumed.\"] } ``` #### Results + The subscription should remain `canceled` + The next billing date should not have changed ### Resuming Subscription Which Was Trialing + Given you have a `trial_ended` subscription, and it is resumable + And the subscription was canceled in the middle of a trial + And there is still time left on the trial + Send a PUT request to `https:\/\/acme.chargify.com\/subscriptions\/{subscription_id}\/reactivate.json?resume=true` #### Results + The subscription will transition to trialing + The next billing date should not have changed ### Resuming Subscription Which Was trial_ended + Given you have a `trial_ended` subscription, and it is resumable + Send a PUT request to `https:\/\/acme.chargify.com\/subscriptions\/{subscription_id}\/reactivate.json?resume=true` #### Results + The subscription will transition to active + The next billing date should not have changed + Any product-related charges should have been collected"}

The `data` key contains an array of files. Each resource in the array is a separate file object and contains the full representation of the file. The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag\/Pagination). #### Filtering You can optionally request that the response only include files that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https:\/\/api.osf.io\/v2\/nodes\/ezcuj\/files\/osfstorage\/?filter[kind]=file Node files may be filtered by `id`, `name`, `node`, `kind`, `path`, `provider`, `size`, and `last_touched`. ### Waterbutler API actions Files can be modified through the Waterbutler API routes found in `links` (`new_folder`, `move`, `upload`, `download`, and `delete`). #### Download (files) To download a file, issue a GET request against the download link. The response will have the Content-Disposition header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser. #### Create Subfolder (folders) You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the new_folder link. The ?kind=folder portion of the query parameter is already included in the new_folder link. The name of the new subfolder should be provided in the name query parameter. The response will contain a WaterButler folder entity. If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response. #### Upload New File (folders) To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's upload link with the raw file data in the request body, and the kind and name query parameters set to 'file' and the desired name of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the new file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response. #### Update Existing File (file) To update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's upload link with the raw file data in the request body and the kind query parameter set to \"file\". The update action will create a new version of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the updated file. #### Rename (files, folders) To rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the move link with the action body parameter set to \"rename\" and the rename body parameter set to the desired name. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name. #### Move & Copy (files, folders) Move and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the move url, but with different values for the action body parameters. The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file's name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be ' (x)' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name. Files and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file\/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file\/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers. If a moved\/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned. #### Delete (file, folders) To delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the delete link. Nothing will be returned in the response body."}
